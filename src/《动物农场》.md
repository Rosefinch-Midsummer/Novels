虽然乔治·奥威尔的作品对人们认识苏联及其附属国的真面目起到了很大的作用，并在其临终前举报了他在英国的“comrades’，但我们仍应视其为致力于摧毁人类文明的“社会主义分子”。

# Plot summary

The animal populace of the poorly run Manor Farm near [Willingdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willingdon_and_Jevington "Willingdon and Jevington"), England, is ripened for rebellion by neglect at the hands of the irresponsible and alcoholic farmer, [Mr. Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_(Animal_Farm) "Jones (Animal Farm)"). One night, the exalted boar, [Old Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Major "Old Major"), holds a conference, at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called "[Beasts of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beasts_of_England "Beasts of England")". When Old Major dies, two young pigs, [Snowball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_(Animal_Farm) "Snowball (Animal Farm)") and [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_(Animal_Farm) "Napoleon (Animal Farm)"), assume command and stage a revolt, driving Mr. Jones off the farm and renaming the property "Animal Farm". They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, "All animals are equal". The decree is painted in large letters on one side of the barn. Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of [Animalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm#Animalism). To commemorate the start of Animal Farm, Snowball raises a green flag with a white hoof and horn. Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their health. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Jones and his associates to retake the farm (later dubbed the "Battle of the Cowshed"), Snowball announces his plans to modernise the farm by building a windmill. Napoleon disputes this idea, and matters come to a head, which culminates in Napoleon's dogs chasing Snowball away and Napoleon effectively declaring himself supreme commander.

Napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm. Through a young porker named [Squealer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squealer_(Animal_Farm) "Squealer (Animal Farm)"), Napoleon claims credit for the idea of building the windmill, claiming that Snowball was only trying to win animals to his side. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer persuade the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project, and begin to [purge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purge "Purge") the farm of animals accused by Napoleon of consorting with his old rival. When some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon (who was nowhere to be found during the battle) gradually smears Snowball to the point of saying he is a collaborator of Mr. Jones, even dismissing the fact that Snowball was given an award of courage while falsely representing himself as the main hero of the battle. "Beasts of England" is replaced with "Animal Farm", while an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who is presumably adopting the lifestyle of a man ("Comrade Napoleon"), is composed and sung. Napoleon then conducts a second purge, during which many animals who are alleged to be helping Snowball in plots are executed by Napoleon's dogs, which troubles the rest of the animals. Despite their hardships, the animals are easily placated by Napoleon's retort that they are better off than they were under Mr. Jones, as well as by the sheep's continual bleating of "four legs good, two legs bad".

Mr. Frederick, a neighbouring farmer, attacks the farm, using [blasting powder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material "Explosive material") to blow up the restored windmill. Although the animals win the battle, they do so [at great cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory "Pyrrhic victory"), as many, including [Boxer the workhorse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_(Animal_Farm) "Boxer (Animal Farm)"), are wounded. Although he recovers from this, Boxer eventually collapses while working on the windmill (being almost 12 years old at that point). He is taken away in a [knacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knacker "Knacker")'s van and a donkey called Benjamin alerts the animals of this, but Squealer quickly waves off their alarm by persuading the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital and that the previous owner's signboard had not been repainted. Squealer subsequently reports Boxer's death and honours him with a festival the following day. In truth, Napoleon had engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy [whisky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky "Whisky") for themselves.

Years pass, the windmill is rebuilt and another windmill is constructed, which makes the farm a good amount of income. However, the ideals that Snowball discussed, including stalls with electric lighting, heating, and running water, are forgotten, with Napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives. Snowball has been forgotten, alongside Boxer, with "the exception of the few who knew him". Many of the animals who participated in the rebellion are dead or old. Mr. Jones is also now known to be dead, having "died in an inebriates' home in another part of the country". The pigs start to resemble humans, as they walk upright, carry whips, drink alcohol, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are abridged to just one phrase: "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others". The maxim "Four legs good, two legs bad" is similarly changed to "Four legs good, two legs better". Other changes include the Hoof and Horn flag being replaced with a plain green banner and Old Major's skull, which was previously put on display, being reburied.

Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance. He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name "The Manor Farm". The men and pigs start playing cards, flattering and praising each other while cheating at the game. Both Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington, one of the farmers, play the [Ace of Spades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_of_spades "Ace of spades") at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first. When the animals outside look at the pigs and men, they can no longer distinguish between the two.

# Characters

## Pigs

- [Old Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Major "Old Major") – An aged prize [Middle White boar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_White "Middle White") provides the inspiration that fuels the rebellion. He is also called Willingdon Beauty when [showing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_(animal) "Show (animal)"). He is an allegorical combination of [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx"), one of the creators of communism, and [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin"), the communist leader of the [Russian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution "Russian Revolution") and the early Soviet nation, in that he draws up the principles of the revolution. His skull being put on revered public display recalls Lenin, whose [embalmed body was left in indefinite repose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin%27s_Mausoleum "Lenin's Mausoleum"). By the end of the book, the skull is reburied.
- [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_(Animal_Farm) "Napoleon (Animal Farm)") – "A large, rather fierce-looking [Berkshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_pig "Berkshire pig") boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way". An allegory of [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin"),Napoleon is the leader of Animal Farm.
- [Snowball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_(Animal_Farm) "Snowball (Animal Farm)") – Napoleon's rival and original head of the farm after Jones's overthrow. His life parallels that of [Leon Trotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky "Leon Trotsky"), although there is no reference to Snowball having been murdered (as Trotsky was); he may also combine some elements from Lenin.
- [Squealer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squealer_(Animal_Farm) "Squealer (Animal Farm)") – A small, white, fat porker who serves as Napoleon's second-in-command and minister of propaganda, is a collective portrait of the Soviet [nomenklatura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenklatura "Nomenklatura") and journalists, such as of the national daily _[Pravda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravda "Pravda") (The Truth)_, able to justify every twist and turn in Stalin's policy.
- Minimus – A poetic pig who writes the second national anthem of Animal Farm after the singing of "Beasts of England" is banned; later he composes a poem "Comrade Napoleon". Literary theorist John Rodden compares him to the poet [Vladimir Mayakovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Mayakovsky "Vladimir Mayakovsky"),who eulogized Lenin and the Soviet Union, although Mayakovsky neither wrote anthems nor praised Stalin in his poems.
- The piglets – Hinted to be the children of Napoleon and are the first generation of animals subjugated to his idea of animal inequality.
- The young pigs – Four pigs who complain about Napoleon's takeover of the farm but are quickly silenced and later executed, the first animals killed in Napoleon's farm purge. Probably based on the [Great Purge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge "Great Purge") of [Grigory Zinoviev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Zinoviev "Grigory Zinoviev"), [Lev Kamenev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Kamenev "Lev Kamenev"), [Nikolai Bukharin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Bukharin "Nikolai Bukharin"), and [Alexei Rykov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Rykov "Alexei Rykov").
- Pinkeye – A minor pig who is mentioned only once; he is the taste-tester that samples Napoleon's food to make sure it is not poisoned, in response to rumours about an assassination attempt on Napoleon.

## Humans

- [Mr. Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_(Animal_Farm) "Jones (Animal Farm)") – A heavy drinker who is the original owner of Manor Farm, a farm in disrepair with farmhands who often loaf on the job. He is an allegory of Russian [Tsar Nicholas II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Nicholas_II "Tsar Nicholas II"),who was forced to abdicate following the [February Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_Revolution "February Revolution") of 1917 and was murdered, along with the rest of his family, by the [Bolsheviks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks "Bolsheviks") on 17 July 1918. The animals revolt after Jones goes on a drinking binge, returns hungover the following day and neglects them completely. Jones is married, but his wife plays no active role in the book. She seems to live with her husband's drunkenness, going to bed while he stays up drinking until late into the night. In her only other appearance, she hastily throws a few things into a travel bag and flees when she sees that the animals are revolting. Towards the end of the book, Napoleon's "favourite sow" wears her old Sunday dress.
- Mr. Frederick – The tough owner of Pinchfield Farm, a small but well-kept neighbouring farm, who briefly allies with Napoleon. Animal Farm shares land boundaries with Pinchfield on one side and Foxwood on another, making Animal Farm a "buffer zone" between the two bickering farmers. The animals of Animal Farm are terrified of Frederick, as rumours abound of him abusing his animals and entertaining himself with [cockfighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockfighting "Cockfighting"). Napoleon allies with Frederick to sell surplus timber that Pilkington also sought, but is enraged to learn Frederick paid him in counterfeit money. Shortly after the swindling, Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm, killing many animals and destroying the windmill. The brief alliance and subsequent invasion may allude to the [Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact "Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact") and [Operation Barbarossa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa "Operation Barbarossa").
- Mr. Pilkington – The easy-going but crafty and well-to-do owner of Foxwood Farm, a large neighbouring farm overgrown with weeds. Pilkington is wealthier than Frederick and owns more land, but his farm needs care as opposed to Frederick's smaller but more efficiently run farm. Although on bad terms with Frederick, Pilkington is also concerned about the animal revolution that deposed Jones and is worried that this could also happen to him.
- Mr. Whymper – A man hired by Napoleon to act as the liaison between Animal Farm and human society. At first, he acquires necessities that cannot be produced on the farm, such as dog biscuits and [paraffin wax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraffin_wax "Paraffin wax"), but later he procures luxuries like alcohol for the pigs.

## Equines

- [Boxer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_(Animal_Farm) "Boxer (Animal Farm)") – A loyal, kind, dedicated, extremely strong, hard-working, and respectable cart-horse, although quite naive and gullible. Boxer does a large share of the physical labour on the farm. He is shown to hold the belief that "Napoleon is always right". At one point, he challenged Squealer's statement that Snowball was always against the welfare of the farm, earning him an attack from Napoleon's dogs. But Boxer's immense strength repels the attack, worrying the pigs that their authority can be challenged. Boxer has been compared to [Alexey Stakhanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Stakhanov "Alexei Stakhanov"), a diligent and enthusiastic role model of the [Stakhanovite movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakhanovite_movement "Stakhanovite movement").He has been described as "faithful and strong"; he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder. When Boxer is injured, Napoleon sells him to a local [knacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knacker "Knacker") to buy himself whisky, and Squealer gives a moving account, falsifying the circumstances of Boxer's death.
- Mollie – A self-centred, self-indulgent, and vain young white mare who quickly leaves for another farm after the revolution, like those who left Russia after the fall of the Tsar. She is only once mentioned again.
- Clover – A gentle, caring mare, who shows concern, especially for Boxer, who often pushes himself too hard. Clover can read all the letters of the alphabet, but cannot "put words together".
- [Benjamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_(Animal_Farm) "Benjamin (Animal Farm)") – A donkey, one of the oldest, wisest animals on the farm, and one of the few who can read properly. He is sceptical, temperamental and cynical: his most frequent remark is, "Life will go on as it has always gone on – that is, badly". Academic [Morris Dickstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Dickstein "Morris Dickstein") has suggested there is "a touch of Orwell himself in this creature's timeless scepticism"and indeed, friends called Orwell "Donkey George", "after his grumbling donkey Benjamin, in _Animal Farm_".Benjamin manages to evade the purges and survive despite the threat he potentially poses given his knowledge, his age, and his equivocal, albeit apolitical, positions.

## Other animals

- Muriel – A goat who is another of the oldest, wisest animals on the farm and friends with all of the animals on the farm. Similar to Benjamin, Muriel is one of the few animals on the farm who is not a pig but can read. She survives, as does Benjamin, by eschewing politics.
- The puppies – Offspring of Jessie and Bluebell, the puppies were taken away at birth by Napoleon and raised by him to serve as his powerful security force.
- Moses – The Raven, "Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker". Initially following Mrs. Jones into exile, he reappears several years later and resumes his role of talking but not working. He regales Animal Farm's denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called "Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours!" Orwell portrays [established religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_politics "Religion and politics") as "the black raven of priestcraft – promising pie in the sky when you die, and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power". His preaching to the animals heartens them, and Napoleon allows Moses to reside at the farm "with an allowance of a gill of beer daily", akin to how Stalin brought back the [Russian Orthodox Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church "Russian Orthodox Church") during the Second World War.
- The sheep – They are not given individual names or personalities. They show limited understanding of Animalism and the political atmosphere of the farm, yet nonetheless, they are the voice of blind conformity as they bleat their support of Napoleon's ideals with jingles during his speeches and meetings with Snowball. Their constant bleating of "four legs good, two legs bad" was used as a device to drown out any opposition or alternative views from Snowball, much as Stalin used hysterical crowds to drown out Trotsky.Towards the end of the book, Squealer (the [propagandist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagandist "Propagandist")) trains the sheep to alter their slogan to "four legs good, two legs better", which they dutifully do.
- The hens – Unnamed. The hens are promised at the start of the revolution that they will get to keep their eggs, which are stolen from them under Mr. Jones. However, their eggs are soon taken from them under the premise of buying goods from outside Animal Farm. The hens are among the first to rebel, albeit unsuccessfully, against Napoleon. They are brutally suppressed through starvation.
- The cows – Unnamed. The cows are enticed into the revolution by promises that their milk will not be stolen but can be used to raise their calves. Their milk is then stolen by the pigs, who learn to milk them. The milk is stirred into the pigs' mash every day, while the other animals are denied such luxuries.
- The cat – Unnamed and never seen to carry out any work. The cat is absent for long periods and is forgiven because her excuses are so convincing and she "purred so affectionately that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions". She has no interest in the politics of the farm, and the only time she is recorded as having participated in an election, she is found to have actually "voted on both sides". 
- The ducks – Unnamed.
- The roosters – One arranges to wake Boxer early, and a black one acts as a trumpeter for Napoleon.
- The geese – Unnamed. One gander commits suicide by eating nightshade berries.
- The rats — Unnamed. Classed among the wild animals, unsuccessful attempts were made to civilise them and teach them the principles of Animalism.

# 《动物农场》中的角色隐喻

[来源未经考证，仅供参考](https://book.douban.com/review/7461958/)

李零早年作为红小鬼”无法无天“，之后流连于改革开放后的”启蒙主义“，近年来转投”大陆新儒家“摇首乞怜，其观点还是有点可参考之处的。

节选自李零发表于2008年8月号《读书》的书评。措辞略有修改。

我们先介绍人类：  

一）琼斯先生（Mr. Jones），庄园农场的场主。他整天喝酒，醉醺醺，对手下的工人疏于管理。他们光挤奶，不喂草，引起母牛闹事。其他动物群起响应，把琼斯赶走。琼斯流亡在外，住在威灵顿（Willington，英格兰有这个地名），整天泡在红狮酒吧（the taproom of Red Lion）中。威灵顿是人类居住的中心，当指伦敦。伦敦有个红狮街。琼斯失去农场，绝不甘心，勾结弗里德利克和皮尔京顿（详下），攻打动物农场，不成功，最后死在醉汉收容所中。俄国人爱酗酒。作者把他描写成酒鬼，以他象征十月革命推翻的沙俄统治者。此人绝非俄皇，乃指白俄。尼古拉二世是被布尔什维克处决，不是喝酒喝死的。革命，群情激愤不能已，送暴君上断头台，乃欧洲传统，不自俄国始，不自法国始，而是从英国开的头，根本用不着大惊小怪。  

二）弗里德利克先生（Mr. Frederick），狭地农场（Pinchfield Farm）的场主，指希特勒。他的特点，是“精明、强悍，成年累月同别人打官司”，“遇事斤斤计较，一点亏也不肯吃”。Pinchfield，字面含义是受挤压的土地。第一次世界大战，德国是战败国，割地赔款，领土受挤压。原书说，它“面积不大，但是经营得较好”。Frederick是德国姓氏，德语作 Friederich，普鲁士的弗里德里希二世就姓这个姓。

三）皮尔京顿先生（Mr. Pilkington），狸林农场（Foxwood Farm）的场主。Pilkington是英国姓氏。Foxwood是狐狸出没的野树林。英国人喜欢猎狐。原书说，它“是个经营不善的老式大农场，长满了一丛丛小树，牧场荒芜，树篱东倒西歪”，当指大英帝国代表的殖民体系。此人指谁？有人说是丘吉尔和罗斯福，我看是丘吉尔。罗斯福治下的国家，不像是“经营不善的老式大农场”。原书说，“皮尔京顿同弗里德利克两人谁都看不起谁”，但都害怕“动物革命”。他俩是一伙，但有矛盾。  

四）温佩尔先生（Mr. Whymper），住在威灵顿的律师。他是拿破仑（详下）在动物农场实行新经济政策后，第一个为动物农场和人类农场牵线搭桥，促成其贸易往来的经纪人。此人当指美国企业家哈默（Armand Hammer）。一九二一年，他到苏联救济灾民，后来在苏联开过铅笔厂。一九三○年，他返回美国，从苏联买走大批珍宝名画。  

这四个“人”，琼斯是酒囊饭袋老废物，弗里德利克和皮尔京顿也不是什么好东西。他们都不是故事中的英雄人物和正面人物。  

我们再介绍动物。  

（一）猪。  

动物农场中的猪，分种猪和肉猪。种猪是未经阉割专供配种的猪；肉猪是供屠宰吃肉的猪。猪最聪明，借口管理，不干体力活。他们是动物农场的领导阶层，吉拉斯（或译德热拉斯）所说的“新阶级”。人类的遗产，琼斯先生留下的东西，都被他们霸占，他们是“没有琼斯的琼斯先生”，动物农场的真正利益集团。  

一）老少校（Old Major），是动物造反的鼻祖。在故事中，他是一头得过奖的灰白色大公猪，号称“威灵顿美人”（Willington Beauty）。共产主义领袖，马克思、恩格斯，都在伦敦长期居住，在西方名气很大。此名当指马克思和恩格斯，特别是恩格斯。恩格斯是第二国际创始人，当过兵，打过仗，好写军事评论，有“将军”的绰号。恩格斯死后，第二国际分裂，伯恩斯坦、考茨基强调议会道路，是保守派；列宁强调武装夺权，是激进派。两派都源于恩格斯。  

二）拿破仑（Napoleon），是农场中唯一的一头伯克夏种猪，动物农场的三巨头之一。原书说他有“军人风度”（第五章）。第十章，拿破仑会见皮尔京顿，他口叼烟斗，上身穿黑外套，下身穿打猎的马裤（ratcatcher breeches，傅惟慈译为“怪里怪气的猪裤”），腿上打皮绑腿（leather leggings，指马靴），扮相酷似斯大林。论者往往把斯大林叫“共产主义波拿巴”，小说中的拿破仑无疑指斯大林。欧洲传统，王很多，帝很少，帝号源出罗马，日耳曼和斯拉夫系的国家，多称恺撒（caesar）。我们说的沙皇（tsar）就是俄语的恺撒。此书最初译成法文，害怕激怒法国人，曾把“拿破仑” 改成“恺撒”。  

三）雪球（Snowball），也是一头种猪，动物农场的三巨头之一。在“牛棚战役” 中，因保卫动物农场有功，曾获“一级动物英雄”勋章。但他与拿破仑政见相左，导致破裂。在动物大会上，拿破仑纵恶犬，赶走雪球。雪球即托洛茨基。十月革命，他是主要领袖，地位和影响，仅次于列宁。内战时期，他是红军创始人，也有赫赫战功。但列宁死后，被斯大林排挤：一九二五年被解除党内外一切职务，一九二六年被开除出党，一九二八年被流放到阿拉木图，一九二九年被驱逐出境，一九四○年被苏联特工暗杀。  

四）尖噪（Squealer），是一头口才很好的小肉猪，动物农场的三巨头之一，负责意识形态和政治宣传，有人猜，这是指布哈林及其后继者（如日丹诺夫类的理论家），不一定，恐怕还是泛指斯大林的支持者。  

五）四口小肉猪（four young porkers），当指季诺维也夫、加米涅夫、布哈林和李可夫等人。拿破仑赶走雪球，取消动物大会，他们想发表不同意见，引起拿破仑反感。后来，被逼承认，与雪球同伙，被恶犬咬死。苏联大清洗，杀革命功臣，最著名的死难者是季诺维也夫、加米涅夫、图哈切夫斯基、布哈林和李可夫。一九二四年，列宁死后，斯大林先和季诺维也夫、加米涅夫结盟，排挤托洛茨基，再和布哈林、李可夫结盟，排挤季诺维也夫、加米涅夫。季诺维也夫、加米涅夫死于一九三六年的第一次大审判，图哈切夫斯基死于一九三七年的第二次大审判，布哈林、李可夫死于一九三八年的第三次大审判。  

六）诗人小不点儿（the poet, Minimus），是为拿破仑唱赞歌的小肉猪，当指亚历山大罗夫（红旗歌舞团的创始人）等人。第一章，老少校教动物唱《英格兰畜牲之歌》（Beasts of England），当指《国际歌》。十月革命后，苏联废除沙俄时代的国歌《上帝保佑沙皇》，用《国际歌》代替它。Beasts of England，或译“英格兰兽”，不好。Beast有畜牲之义，从故事看，显然指动物农场中的畜牲，而不是虎狼一类野兽。傅本译“英格兰畜牲”，更合适。第七章，拿破仑禁唱《英格兰畜牲之歌》，小不点儿作了一首新歌代替它。新歌是指一九四四年的苏联新国歌《牢不可破的联盟》（亚历山大罗夫作曲，米哈尔科夫、列基斯坦作词）。它只唱祖国，不唱国际。后来，小不点儿还创作了《拿破仑同志》，则指亚历山大罗夫等人创作的《斯大林颂》。  

八）粉红眼（Pinkeye），也是小肉猪，负责为拿破仑品尝食品，以防下毒。  

（二）狗。  

象征秘密警察，地位仅次于猪。  

一）蓝铃花（Bluebell），一种植物，这里是母狗的名字。  

二）杰西（Jessie），本来是女子名，这里是母狗的名字。  

三）品彻尔（Pincher）。意思是钳子，这里是公狗的名字。  

四）九条巨犬（nine enormous dogs），分别出于蓝铃花和杰西。小狗刚一断奶，就被拿破仑抱走，养在一个与世隔绝的阁楼上。后来，拿破仑赶走雪球，在动物农场搞大清洗，就是靠这些恶犬。老乡教我养狗，说最凶的狗，都是从小不见人的狗（见拙作《大营子娃娃小营子狗》），拿破仑的狗就是这么养出来的。  

这些狗，一）至三）是老狗，参加过仲夏暴动，身上有捷尔仁斯基的影子。捷尔仁斯基是契卡的创始人。四）是一）至三）所生，指契卡、安全局、内务部、安全部一类组织（克格勃的前身）。  

（三）马。  

一）拳击手（Boxer），是匹挽重的公马，代表真正的工人阶级。他参加过动物农场的所有革命活动，是个战斗英雄和劳动模范，但被拿破仑愚弄、欺骗和出卖。拳击手常说的两句话是“我要努力干活儿”和“拿破仑永远正确”，对革命忠心耿耿，但临近退休，却被拿破仑送进屠宰场。死后，他这两句话，被拿破仑一伙利用，当做愚弄动物的口号。有人说，奥威尔笔下的拳击手是以他参加西班牙内战时的指挥官乔治•柯普为原型，但我觉得，他身上也有作者本人的影子。  

二）苜蓿（Clover），是匹挽重的母马，总是和拳击手在一起。她也参加过动物农场的所有革命活动，是拳击手的亲密战友。她的身上似乎有爱琳的影子（奥威尔的第一个妻子，她曾在西班牙陪伴奥威尔）。  

三）茉莉（Molie），是给琼斯驾车的小白母马，喜欢吃糖，臭美，爱打扮，经常逃避集体劳动，代表奴性不改、怀念旧社会的人。“牛棚战役” 后，茉莉叛逃威灵顿，给一家酒馆的老板驾车。Molie是Mary的爱称。有人说，奥威尔笔下的茉莉是以他的遗孀索妮亚为原型，不知是否可靠。索妮亚长得很漂亮。  

（四）奶牛。  

无名，疑指农民和普通劳动者。  

（五）绵羊。  

无名，疑指最愚昧的群众，特点是驯服和盲从。例如他们总是动不动就狂呼口号“四条腿好，两条腿坏”（雪球发明的阶级斗争口号）。  

（六）山羊。  

穆瑞尔（Muriel），是一头白山羊，常和本杰明在一起，没什么突出表现。奥威尔的动物农场有沃灵顿村的影子。他在沃灵顿村养过一头母山羊，就叫这个名。  

（七）毛驴。  

本杰明（Benjamin），男子名，源出希伯来语，意思是“幸运儿”。他是动物农场中年龄最大、脾气最坏、冷眼旁观、喜欢说怪话、看笑话的家伙。他的口头禅是“驴子活得长”（意思是，看谁活得长）。有人说，作者是以他比自己，不合适。奥威尔喜欢马而不是驴。他身体特差，根本活不长。

（八）老猫。  

无名，在书中是二流子和落后分子的象征。他好吃懒做，不劳动，经常逃会，干事的时候瞅不见他，但动物农场成立野生同志再教育委员会，他却积极报名，想借职务之便，抓点麻雀、老鼠吃。动物中有所谓宠物（pet），猫、狗是这一类。猫和狗还不一样。狗还帮助狩猎，看家护院。猫，除了抓耗子，啥都不干，特爱睡懒觉（如果有吃有喝，就连耗子都不抓）。  

（九）鸽子。  

无名，和乌鸦相反，不是传播宗教，而是向其他支物农场传播革命思想。五十年代，毕加索的和平鸽（作于一九四九年）在中国很流行，北京展览馆（初名苏联殿览馆）的高塔上有，邮票上也印。左翼当红的一九四四年，他加入过共产党。  

（十）乌鸦。  

摩西（Moses），是琼斯先生养的一只乌鸦。他什么活儿都不干，专卖口舌，说云端后面有座糖果山（Sugarcandy Mountain），人死了都要到那儿去。糖果山每天都是休息日，苜蓿一年四季常青，篱笆上长满方糖和亚麻子饼。革命前，为了唤醒动物的革命意识，猪给所有动物做工作，叫他们不要相信摩西的说教。仲夏暴动，摩西逃跑。动物共和国成立后，摩西又飞回来。摩西本是《旧约》中的犹太领袖，出埃及，立十诫。这里指俄国的东正教。十月革命后，苏联政府曾限制东正教。一九四三年，为了支持对德战争，苏联政府与东正教达成和解，东正教才重新活跃起来。  

（十一）鸡、鸭、鹅。  

无名，代表最无知的一般群众。  

（十二）麻雀、老鼠、兔子、狐狸。  

这些是野生动物。

THE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS

1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.

2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.

3. No animal shall wear clothes.

4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.

5. No animal shall drink alcohol.

6. No animal shall kill any other animal.

7. All animals are equal.

最终变为：

**ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL**

**BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS**

《十诫》也有魔改之处。

在《旧约·出埃及记》第二十章可以找到十诫。神将以色列人从埃及的奴役中解救出来后，在西奈山上直接将十诫赐给他们：  
  
“神吩咐这一切的话，说：‘我是耶和华你的神……  
  
第一：‘除了我以外，你不可有别的神。’  
  
第二：‘不可为自己雕刻偶像；也不可作什么形象仿佛上天、下地和地底下、水中的百物。’  
  
第三：‘不可妄称耶和华你神的名。’  
  
第四：‘当记念安息日，守为圣日。’  
  
第五：‘当孝敬父母。’  
  
第六：‘不可杀人。’  
  
第七：‘不可奸淫。’  
  
第八：‘不可偷盗。’  
  
第九：‘不可作假见证陷害人。’  
  
第十：‘不可贪恋人的房屋；也不可贪恋人的妻子、仆婢、牛驴，并他一切所有的。’


None of the other animals on the farm could get further than the letter A. It was also found that the stupider animals, such as the sheep, hens, and ducks, were unable to learn the Seven Commandments by heart. After much thought Snowball declared that the Seven Commandments could in effect be reduced to a single maxim, namely: "Four legs good, two legs bad." This, he said, contained the essential principle of Animalism. Whoever had thoroughly grasped it would be safe from human influences. The birds at first objected, since it seemed to them that they also had two legs, but Snowball proved to them that this was not so.

信教者和不信教者区别明显。

BY THE LATE SUMMER the news of what had happened on Animal Farm had spread across half the county. Every day Snowball and Napoleon sent out flights of pigeons whose instructions were to mingle with the animals on neighbouring farms, tell them the story of the Rebellion, and teach them the tune of "Beasts of England."

输出暴乱。

Most of this time Mr. Jones had spent sitting in the taproom of the Red Lion at Willingdon, complaining to anyone who would listen of the monstrous injustice he had suffered in being turned out of his property by a pack of good-for-nothing animals. The other farmers sympathised in principle, but they did not at first give him much help. At heart, each of them was secretly wondering whether he could not somehow turn Jones's misfortune to his own advantage. It was lucky that the owners of the two farms which adjoined Animal Farm were on permanently bad terms. One of them, which was named Foxwood, was a large, neglected, old-fashioned farm, much overgrown by woodland, with all its pastures worn out and its hedges in a disgraceful condition. Its owner, Mr. Pilkington, was an easy-going gentleman farmer who spent most of his time in fishing or hunting according to the season. The other farm, which was called Pinchfield, was smaller and better kept. Its owner was a Mr. Frederick, a tough, shrewd man, perpetually involved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hard bargains. These two disliked each other so much that it was difficult for them to come to any agreement, even in defence of their own interests.

Nevertheless, they were both thoroughly frightened by the rebellion on Animal Farm, and very anxious to prevent their own animals from learning too much about it. At first they pretended to laugh to scorn the idea of animals managing a farm for themselves. The whole thing would be over in a fortnight, they said. They put it about that the animals on the Manor Farm (they insisted on calling it the Manor Farm; they would not tolerate the name "Animal Farm") were perpetually fighting among themselves and were also rapidly starving to death. When time passed and the animals had evidently not starved to death, Frederick and Pilkington changed their tune and began to talk of the terrible wickedness that now flourished on Animal Farm. It was given out that the animals there practised cannibalism, tortured one another with red-hot horseshoes, and had their females in common. This was what came of rebelling against the laws of Nature, Frederick and Pilkington said.

共产共妻

This had long been expected, and all preparations had been made. Snowball, who had studied an old book of Julius Caesar's campaigns which he had found in the farmhouse, was in charge of the defensive operations. He gave his orders quickly, and in a couple of minutes every animal was at his post.

As the human beings approached the farm buildings, Snowball launched his first attack. All the pigeons, to the number of thirty-five, flew to and fro over the men's heads and muted upon them from mid-air; and while the men were dealing with this, the geese, who had been hiding behind the hedge, rushed out and pecked viciously at the calves of their legs. However, this was only a light skirmishing manoeuvre, intended to create a little disorder, and the men easily drove the geese off with their sticks. Snowball now launched his second line of attack. Muriel, Benjamin, and all the sheep, with Snowball at the head of them, rushed forward and prodded and butted the men from every side, while Benjamin turned round and lashed at them with his small hoofs. But once again the men, with their sticks and their hob-nailed boots, were too strong for them; and suddenly, at a squeal from Snowball, which was the signal for retreat, all the animals turned and fled through the gateway into the yard.

白俄、外国干涉军（包括中国军队）

"No sentimentality, comrade!" cried Snowball, from whose wounds the blood was still dripping. "War is war. The only good human being is a dead one."

**As usual, Snowball and Napoleon were in disagreement. According to Napoleon, what the animals must do was to procure firearms and train themselves in the use of them. According to Snowball, they must send out more and more pigeons and stir up rebellion among the animals on the other farms. The one argued that if they could not defend themselves they were bound to be conquered, the other argued that if rebellions happened everywhere they would have no need to defend themselves. The animals listened first to Napoleon, then to Snowball, and could not make up their minds which was right; indeed, they always found themselves in agreement with the one who was speaking at the moment.**

分歧：先建设俄罗斯还是先搞“世界革命”。

"Comrades," he said, "I trust that every animal here appreciates the sacrifice that Comrade Napoleon has made in taking this extra labour upon himself. Do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is a pleasure! On the contrary, it is a deep and heavy responsibility. No one believes more firmly than Comrade Napoleon that all animals are equal. He would be only too happy to let you make your decisions for yourselves. But sometimes you might make the wrong decisions, comrades, and then where should we be? Suppose you had decided to follow Snowball, with his moonshine of windmills—Snowball, who, as we now know, was no better than a criminal?"

On the third Sunday after Snowball's expulsion, the animals were somewhat surprised to hear Napoleon announce that the windmill was to be built after all. He did not give any reason for having changed his mind, but merely warned the animals that this extra task would mean very hard work; it might even be necessary to reduce their rations. The plans, however, had all been prepared, down to the last detail. A special committee of pigs had been at work upon them for the past three weeks. The building of the windmill, with various other improvements, was expected to take two years.

极权主义主打的就是一个猝不及防 180° 转弯，例如防疫政策。

**That evening Squealer explained privately to the other animals that Napoleon had never in reality been opposed to the windmill. On the contrary, it was he who had advocated it in the beginning, and the plan which Snowball had drawn on the floor of the incubator shed had actually been stolen from among Napoleon's papers. The windmill was, in fact, Napoleon's own creation. Why, then, asked somebody, had he spoken so strongly against it? Here Squealer looked very sly. That, he said, was Comrade Napoleon's cunning. He had seemed to oppose the windmill, simply as a manoeuvre to get rid of Snowball, who was a dangerous character and a bad influence. Now that Snowball was out of the way, the plan could go forward without his interference. This, said Squealer, was something called tactics. He repeated a number of times, "Tactics, comrades, tactics!" skipping round and whisking his tail with a merry laugh. The animals were not certain what the word meant, but Squealer spoke so persuasively, and the three dogs who happened to be with him growled so threateningly, that they accepted his explanation without further questions.**

太典了！

**One Sunday morning, when the animals assembled to receive their orders, Napoleon announced that he had decided upon a new policy. From now onwards Animal Farm would engage in trade with the neighbouring farms: not, of course, for any commercial purpose, but simply in order to obtain certain materials which were urgently necessary. The needs of the windmill must override everything else, he said. He was therefore making arrangements to sell a stack of hay and part of the current year's wheat crop, and later on, if more money were needed, it would have to be made up by the sale of eggs, for which there was always a market in Willingdon. The hens, said Napoleon, should welcome this sacrifice as their own special contribution towards the building of the windmill.**

**Once again the animals were conscious of a vague uneasiness. Never to have any dealings with human beings, never to engage in trade, never to make use of money—had not these been among the earliest resolutions passed at that first triumphant Meeting after Jones was expelled? All the animals remembered passing such resolutions: or at least they thought that they remembered it. The four young pigs who had protested when Napoleon abolished the Meetings raised their voices timidly, but they were promptly silenced by a tremendous growling from the dogs. Then, as usual, the sheep broke into "Four legs good, two legs bad!" and the momentary awkwardness was smoothed over. Finally Napoleon raised his trotter for silence and announced that he had already made all the arrangements. There would be no need for any of the animals to come in contact with human beings, which would clearly be most undesirable. He intended to take the whole burden upon his own shoulders. A Mr. Whymper, a solicitor living in Willingdon, had agreed to act as intermediary between Animal Farm and the outside world, and would visit the farm every Monday morning to receive his instructions. Napoleon ended his speech with his usual cry of "Long live Animal Farm!" and after the singing of "Beasts of England" the animals were dismissed.**

**Afterwards Squealer made a round of the farm and set the animals' minds at rest. He assured them that the resolution against engaging in trade and using money had never been passed, or even suggested. It was pure imagination, probably traceable in the beginning to lies circulated by Snowball. A few animals still felt faintly doubtful, but Squealer asked them shrewdly, "Are you certain that this is not something that you have dreamed, comrades? Have you any record of such a resolution? Is it written down anywhere?" And since it was certainly true that nothing of the kind existed in writing, the animals were satisfied that they had been mistaken.**

**Nevertheless, the sight of Napoleon, on all fours, delivering orders to Whymper, who stood on two legs, roused their pride and partly reconciled them to the new arrangement. Their relations with the human race were now not quite the same as they had been before**. 

**It was about this time that the pigs suddenly moved into the farmhouse and took up their residence there. Again the animals seemed to remember that a resolution against this had been passed in the early days, and again Squealer was able to convince them that this was not the case. It was absolutely necessary, he said, that the pigs, who were the brains of the farm, should have a quiet place to work in. It was also more suited to the dignity of the Leader (for of late he had taken to speaking of Napoleon under the title of "Leader") to live in a house than in a mere sty. Nevertheless, some of the animals were disturbed when they heard that the pigs not only took their meals in the kitchen and used the drawing-room as a recreation room, but also slept in the beds**.

**Squealer made excellent speeches on the joy of service and the dignity of labour, but the other animals found more inspiration in Boxer's strength and his never-failing cry of "I will work harder!"**

In January food fell short. The corn ration was drastically reduced, and it was announced that an extra potato ration would be issued to make up for it. Then it was discovered that the greater part of the potato crop had been frosted in the clamps, which had not been covered thickly enough. The potatoes had become soft and discoloured, and only a few were edible. For days at a time the animals had nothing to eat but chaff and mangels. Starvation seemed to stare them in the face.

It was vitally necessary to conceal this fact from the outside world. Emboldened by the collapse of the windmill, the human beings were inventing fresh lies about Animal Farm. Once again it was being put about that all the animals were dying of famine and disease, and that they were continually fighting among themselves and had resorted to cannibalism and infanticide. Napoleon was well aware of the bad results that might follow if the real facts of the food situation were known, and he decided to make use of Mr. Whymper to spread a contrary impression. Hitherto the animals had had little or no contact with Whymper on his weekly visits: now, however, a few selected animals, mostly sheep, were instructed to remark casually in his hearing that rations had been increased. In addition, Napoleon ordered the almost empty bins in the store-shed to be filled nearly to the brim with sand, which was then covered up with what remained of the grain and meal. On some suitable pretext Whymper was led through the store-shed and allowed to catch a glimpse of the bins. He was deceived, and continued to report to the outside world that there was no food shortage on Animal Farm.

大饥荒

鲁迅之流的狗汉奸、萧伯纳之类的无耻文人都传播了不少大饥荒时期的苏联的鬼话。

**It was noticed that whenever he seemed on the point of coming to an agreement with Frederick, Snowball was declared to be in hiding at Foxwood, while, when he inclined toward Pilkington, Snowball was said to be at Pinchfield.**

**"Comrades!" cried Squealer, making little nervous skips, "a most terrible thing has been discovered. Snowball has sold himself to Frederick of Pinchfield Farm, who is even now plotting to attack us and take our farm away from us! Snowball is to act as his guide when the attack begins. But there is worse than that. We had thought that Snowball's rebellion was caused simply by his vanity and ambition. But we were wrong, comrades. Do you know what the real reason was? Snowball was in league with Jones from the very start! He was Jones's secret agent all the time. It has all been proved by documents which he left behind him and which we have only just discovered. To my mind this explains a great deal, comrades. Did we not see for ourselves how he attempted—fortunately without success—to get us defeated and destroyed at the Battle of the Cowshed?"**

You, Boxer, the very day that those great muscles of yours lose their power, Jones will sell you to the knacker, who will cut your throat and boil you down for the foxhounds. As for the dogs, when they grow old and toothless, Jones ties a brick round their necks and drowns them in the nearest pond.

**That gave the animals pause, and there was a hush. Muriel began to spell out the words. But Benjamin pushed her aside and in the midst of a deadly silence he read:**

**"'Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler, Willingdon. Dealer in Hides and Bone-Meal. Kennels Supplied.' Do you not understand what that means? They are taking Boxer to the knacker's!"**

# Animal Farm Full English Text（附带繁体中文版本翻译）
## Chapter 1

MR. JONES, OF THE Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the popholes. With the ring of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring.

As soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring and a fluttering all through the farm buildings. Word had gone round during the day that old Major, the prize Middle White boar, had had a strange dream on the previous night and wished to communicate it to the other animals. It had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as soon as Mr. Jones was safely out of the way. Old Major (so he was always called, though the name under which he had been exhibited was Willingdon Beauty) was so highly regarded on the farm that everyone was quite ready to lose an hour's sleep in order to hear what he had to say.

At one end of the big barn, on a sort of raised platform, Major was already ensconced on his bed of straw, under a lantern which hung from a beam. He was twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout, but he was still a majestic-looking pig, with a wise and benevolent appearance in spite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut. Before long the other animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable after their different fashions. First came the three dogs, Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher, and then the pigs, who settled down in the straw immediately in front of the platform. The hens perched themselves on the windowsills, the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters, the sheep and cows lay down behind the pigs and began to chew the cud. The two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover, came in together, walking very slowly and setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be some small animal concealed in the straw. Clover was a stout motherly mare approaching middle life, who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal. Boxer was an enormous beast, nearly eighteen hands high, and as strong as any two ordinary horses put together. A white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupid appearance, and in fact he was not of first-rate intelligence, but he was universally respected for his steadiness of character and tremendous powers of work. After the horses came Muriel, the white goat, and Benjamin, the donkey. Benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm, and the worst tempered. He seldom talked, and when he did, it was usually to make some cynical remark—for instance, he would say that God had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would sooner have had no tail and no flies. Alone among the animals on the farm he never laughed. If asked why, he would say that he saw nothing to laugh at. Nevertheless, without openly admitting it, he was devoted to Boxer; the two of them usually spent their Sundays together in the small paddock beyond the orchard, grazing side by side and never speaking.

The two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings, which had lost their mother, filed into the barn, cheeping feebly and wandering from side to side to find some place where they would not be trodden on. Clover made a sort of wall round them with her great foreleg, and the ducklings nestled down inside it and promptly fell asleep. At the last moment Mollie, the foolish, pretty white mare who drew Mr. Jones's trap, came mincing daintily in, chewing at a lump of sugar. She took a place near the front and began flirting her white mane, hoping to draw attention to the red ribbons it was plaited with. Last of all came the cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest place, and finally squeezed herself in between Boxer and Clover; there she purred contentedly throughout Major's speech without listening to a word of what he was saying.

All the animals were now present except Moses, the tame raven, who slept on a perch behind the back door. When Major saw that they had all made themselves comfortable and were waiting attentively, he cleared his throat and began:

"Comrades, you have heard already about the strange dream that I had last night. But I will come to the dream later. I have something else to say first. I do not think, comrades, that I shall be with you for many months longer, and before I die, I feel it my duty to pass on to you such wisdom as I have acquired. I have had a long life, I have had much time for thought as I lay alone in my stall, and I think I may say that I understand the nature of life on this earth as well as any animal now living. It is about this that I wish to speak to you.

"Now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours? Let us face it: our lives are miserable, laborious, and short. We are born, we are given just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us who are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength; and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are slaughtered with hideous cruelty. No animal in England knows the meaning of happiness or leisure after he is a year old. No animal in England is free. The life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is the plain truth.

"But is this simply part of the order of nature? Is it because this land of ours is so poor that it cannot afford a decent life to those who dwell upon it? No, comrades, a thousand times no! The soil of England is fertile, its climate is good, it is capable of affording food in abundance to an enormously greater number of animals than now inhabit it. This single farm of ours would support a dozen horses, twenty cows, hundreds of sheep—and all of them living in a comfort and a dignity that are now almost beyond our imagining. Why then do we continue in this miserable condition? Because nearly the whole of the produce of our labour is stolen from us by human beings. There, comrades, is the answer to all our problems. It is summed up in a single word—Man. Man is the only real enemy we have. Remove Man from the scene, and the root cause of hunger and overwork is abolished for ever.

"Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself. Our labour tills the soil, our dung fertilises it, and yet there is not one of us that owns more than his bare skin. You cows that I see before me, how many thousands of gallons of milk have you given during this last year? And what has happened to that milk which should have been breeding up sturdy calves? Every drop of it has gone down the throats of our enemies. And you hens, how many eggs have you laid in this last year, and how many of those eggs ever hatched into chickens? The rest have all gone to market to bring in money for Jones and his men. And you, Clover, where are those four foals you bore, who should have been the support and pleasure of your old age? Each was sold at a year old—you will never see one of them again. In return for your four confinements and all your labour in the fields, what have you ever had except your bare rations and a stall?

"And even the miserable lives we lead are not allowed to reach their natural span. For myself I do not grumble, for I am one of the lucky ones. I am twelve years old and have had over four hundred children. Such is the natural life of a pig. But no animal escapes the cruel knife in the end. You young porkers who are sitting in front of me, every one of you will scream your lives out at the block within a year. To that horror we all must come—cows, pigs, hens, sheep, everyone. Even the horses and the dogs have no better fate. You, Boxer, the very day that those great muscles of yours lose their power, Jones will sell you to the knacker, who will cut your throat and boil you down for the foxhounds. As for the dogs, when they grow old and toothless, Jones ties a brick round their necks and drowns them in the nearest pond.

"Is it not crystal clear, then, comrades, that all the evils of this life of ours spring from the tyranny of human beings? Only get rid of Man, and the produce of our labour would be our own. Almost overnight we could become rich and free. What then must we do? Why, work night and day, body and soul, for the overthrow of the human race! That is my message to you, comrades: Rebellion! I do not know when that Rebellion will come, it might be in a week or in a hundred years, but I know, as surely as I see this straw beneath my feet, that sooner or later justice will be done. Fix your eyes on that, comrades, throughout the short remainder of your lives! And above all, pass on this message of mine to those who come after you, so that future generations shall carry on the struggle until it is victorious.

"And remember, comrades, your resolution must never falter. No argument must lead you astray. Never listen when they tell you that Man and the animals have a common interest, that the prosperity of the one is the prosperity of the others. It is all lies. Man serves the interests of no creature except himself. And among us animals let there be perfect unity, perfect comradeship in the struggle. All men are enemies. All animals are comrades."

At this moment there was a tremendous uproar. While Major was speaking four large rats had crept out of their holes and were sitting on their hindquarters, listening to him. The dogs had suddenly caught sight of them, and it was only by a swift dash for their holes that the rats saved their lives. Major raised his trotter for silence.

"Comrades," he said, "here is a point that must be settled. The wild creatures, such as rats and rabbits—are they our friends or our enemies? Let us put it to the vote. I propose this question to the meeting: Are rats comrades?"

The vote was taken at once, and it was agreed by an overwhelming majority that rats were comrades. There were only four dissentients, the three dogs and the cat, who was afterwards discovered to have voted on both sides. Major continued:

**"I have little more to say. I merely repeat, remember always your duty of enmity towards Man and all his ways. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. And remember also that in fighting against Man, we must not come to resemble him. Even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his vices. No animal must ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes, or drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage in trade. All the habits of Man are evil. And, above all, no animal must ever tyrannise over his own kind. Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers. No animal must ever kill any other animal. All animals are equal.**

"And now, comrades, I will tell you about my dream of last night. I cannot describe that dream to you. It was a dream of the earth as it will be when Man has vanished. But it reminded me of something that I had long forgotten. Many years ago, when I was a little pig, my mother and the other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the tune and the first three words. I had known that tune in my infancy, but it had long since passed out of my mind. Last night, however, it came back to me in my dream. And what is more, the words of the song also came back—words, I am certain, which were sung by the animals of long ago and have been lost to memory for generations. I will sing you that song now, comrades. I am old and my voice is hoarse, but when I have taught you the tune, you can sing it better for yourselves. It is called 'Beasts of England.'"

Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing. As he had said, his voice was hoarse, but he sang well enough, and it was a stirring tune, something between "Clementine" and "La Cucaracha." The words ran

Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland,

Beasts of every land and clime,

Hearken to my joyful tidings

Of the golden future time.

Soon or late the day is coming,

Tyrant Man shall be o'erthrown,

And the fruitful fields of England

Shall be trod by beasts alone.

Rings shall vanish from our noses,

And the harness from our back,

Bit and spur shall rust forever,

Cruel whips no more shall crack.

Riches more than mind can picture,

Wheat and barley, oats and hay,

Clover, beans, and mangel-wurzels

Shall be ours upon that day.

Bright will shine the fields of England,

Purer shall its waters be,

Sweeter yet shall blow its breezes

On the day that sets us free.

For that day we all must labour,

Though we die before it break;

Cows and horses, geese and turkeys,

All must toil for freedom's sake.

Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland,

Beasts of every land and clime,

Hearken well and spread my tidings

Of the golden future time.



The singing of this song threw the animals into the wildest excitement. Almost before Major had reached the end, they had begun singing it for themselves. Even the stupidest of them had already picked up the tune and a few of the words, and as for the clever ones, such as the pigs and dogs, they had the entire song by heart within a few minutes. And then, after a few preliminary tries, the whole farm burst out into "Beasts of England" in tremendous unison. The cows lowed it, the dogs whined it, the sheep bleated it, the horses whinnied it, the ducks quacked it. They were so delighted with the song that they sang it right through five times in succession, and might have continued singing it all night if they had not been interrupted.

Unfortunately, the uproar awoke Mr. Jones, who sprang out of bed, feeling sure that there was a fox in the yard. He seized the gun which always stood in a corner of his bedroom, and let fly a charge of number 6 shot into the darkness. The pellets buried themselves in the wall of the barn and the meeting broke up hurriedly. Everyone fled to his own sleeping place. The birds jumped on to their perches, the animals settled down in the straw, and the whole farm was asleep in a moment.

## 第一章

天色已晚，曼諾農莊的主人瓊斯先生鎖了雞舍大門，卻醉得忘記關上給雞走的小洞。他踉踉蹌蹌地走過院子，手中的提燈閃耀著一圈光環，晃來晃去就像在跳舞。瓊斯先生在後門口甩掉腳上的靴子，又從貯物室的酒桶裝了最後一杯啤酒來喝才上床。此時，床上的瓊斯太太早已鼾聲大作。

臥室的燈一熄滅，農莊內的倉舍旋即一陣騷動。得過中等白豬獎的老少校前一晚做了個怪夢，他想與其他動物分享夢境內容。白天裡消息便已傳開，大家一致同意在確定瓊斯先生離開後於大穀倉集合。動物們口中的老少校，當初出展時其實被取名為威靈頓美豚。他在農莊裡德高望重，大家都很願意犧牲一小時睡眠時間來聽他談話。

穀倉一端是高起的平台，上面鋪著一層稻草，老少校早已安坐在那裡，頭頂上的屋樑懸著一盞燈。十二歲的老少校雖然近來身形愈顯富態，但仍是頭儀表堂堂的豬，即使獠牙從未修過，看起來還是非常睿智、仁慈。沒多久，動物們陸續到來，各自找了個舒服的地方坐下。最先到的是藍鈴、潔西和品契爾這三條狗，接著是豬群，他們在平台前的稻草堆中直接坐下。母雞臥在窗臺，鴿子拍動翅膀飛到椽木上，羊和牛則坐臥在豬身後，咀嚼著反芻的食物。拳擊手和幸運草這兩匹拉車馬一同前來，他們走得很慢，每次放下毛茸茸的大蹄子時都非常小心，生怕稻草堆裡藏有什麼小動物。幸運草是匹慈祥的母馬，近中年的她體型肥胖，往日的身形在生下第四胎後已不復見。拳擊手是頭巨獸，個頭將近兩公尺，氣力是一般馬匹的兩倍，臉上的白色條紋一直延伸到鼻頭，看起來有點蠢。事實上，拳擊手的腦袋也的確稱不上一流，但他性格沉穩、工作時精力充沛，因而搏得其他動物的尊敬。馬到了以後，白羊穆里兒與驢子班傑明接著現身。班傑明是農莊裡年紀最長的動物，脾氣也最壞，他很少說話，只要一開口就是在憤世嫉俗。比方他會說，神給了他一條尾巴趕蒼蠅，但他寧願不要有尾巴也不要有蒼蠅。在農莊裡，班傑明是唯一不笑的動物，有動物問他為什麼不笑，他就會說沒什麼好笑的。不過，雖然沒有公開承認，但班傑明很喜歡拳擊手，他倆常常一起在果園那邊的小牧場度過週日，彼此肩並著肩吃草，不發一語地消磨時光。

兩匹馬趴在地上後，一群沒了媽媽的小鴨子魚貫進入穀倉，一邊發出微弱的呱呱聲，一邊四處移動想找個不會被踩到的地方。幸運草於是拱起粗壯的前腳形成一道牆，小鴨舒適地坐在其中，很快進入了夢鄉。愚笨但漂亮的白色母馬莫莉平常都幫瓊斯先生拉車，她在最後一刻才嚼著糖塊踩著優雅的碎步翩翩駕到。莫莉選了個比較前面的位置，甩動起白色鬃毛，想讓其他動物注意到繫在上面的紅緞帶。貓是最後一個抵達的動物，一來就如往常般到處尋找最溫暖的位置，最後緊窩在拳擊手和幸運草中間，老少校在演講的時候她半個字都沒聽進去，只顧著滿足地呼嚕叫。

所有動物都到齊了，獨缺被瓊斯先生當寵物養的烏鴉摩西，他在後門棲木上睡覺。老少校看大家都已舒服地坐好並專心等待演講開始，便清清喉嚨說：

「同志們，你們已經知道我昨晚做了個怪夢，但這個夢我稍後再提，有件事我想先說一下。同志們，我能和你們相處的日子只剩下幾個月，在死之前，我認為自己有責任將經年累月得來的智慧傳授給你們。我這輩子活得夠長了，獨自在豬圈時，我有很多時間思考，我想我和所有活著的動物一樣，都體悟到生命的本質，這就是我想跟你們談的事情。

「同志們，我現在要問的是，活著的意義是什麼？讓我們面對現實吧，我們的一生既悲慘又辛勞，而且稍縱即逝。出生之後，我們每天所得到的食物只夠滿足身體基本需求。我們當中較有力氣的總是被迫為工作竭盡精力，一旦我們不再有用處，馬上就會遭到殘忍屠殺。英格蘭所有動物在滿週歲後都忘了什麼是快樂或悠閒。在英格蘭，沒有一隻動物是自由的，動物的生活等於悲慘與苦役，事實擺明了就是如此。

「但這真是自然法則嗎？是不是因為我們居住的土地過於貧瘠，所以這裡的動物無法過舒適的生活？不是這樣的，同志們，絕對不是！英格蘭的土壤肥沃、氣候良好，也因此物產豐饒，養活現在居住於此的動物綽綽有餘，就算有更多更多的動物也不成問題。光我們這座農莊就能養十二匹馬、二十頭牛和幾百隻羊，而且他們的生活會超乎我們想像地舒適、有尊嚴。那麼，為什麼我們還是過得這麼悲慘呢？那是因為我們勞力生產的成果幾乎都被人類竊占了。同志們，我們所有的問題有一個共同的答案，這答案能用一個字眼來簡單說明—人類。人類是唯一真正的敵人，只要把人類趕走，飢餓、過勞等問題就能從根本解決，不再出現。

「人類是唯一只消費而不事生產的傢伙，他們不產乳、不下蛋、力氣太小無法拉犁、跑得不夠快不能抓兔子，但卻是所有動物的統治者。人類驅役動物，只給他們僅夠止飢的稀少糧秣作為回報，自己卻占走大部分食物。我們付出勞力耕地、以糞便肥沃土壤，換得的卻只是這身皮囊。你們這群坐在我面前的乳牛去年產奶量有幾千加侖？這些本該用來餵養健壯小牛的牛奶到哪去了？它們一點一滴都流進我們敵人的喉嚨裡。還有你們這些母雞，去年生了多少顆蛋？其中有多少孵化成小雞？其他全被拿到市場賣，為瓊斯和其他人增添收入。還有你，幸運草，你生的四匹小馬在哪裡？他們原本是你晚年的依靠與慰藉，但是都在一歲的時候就被賣掉，你以後也無法再見到他們。你四次懷胎而且在田裡辛勤工作，但是除了稀少的食物和一間馬廄還得到什麼嗎？

「再者，過著悲慘生活的我們也沒辦法壽終正寢。我自己是不會有怨言，因為我夠幸運的了。我現在十二歲，有四百多頭後代，這樣的生活對一頭豬來說再自然不過。但是沒有一隻動物逃得過殘忍的最後一刀。你們這群坐在我面前的年輕肉豬一年內全會在屠刀下慘叫喪生。我們都得面對這份恐懼—牛、豬、雞、羊，每隻動物皆然，馬和狗也不會有比較好的下場。你，拳擊手，瓊斯會在你氣力用盡那天把你賣給屠馬業者，讓他割斷你的喉嚨，把你煮來給獵狐犬吃。至於狗，當他們老了、牙齒掉光了，瓊斯會在他們脖子上綁一塊磚，在附近的池塘淹死他們。

「同志們，這樣還不夠清楚嗎？我們生活中所有的不幸都來自人類的暴虐。唯有趕走人類，勞力的成果才會歸我們所有，可以說在一夜之間，我們就能成為富有、自由的動物。那麼，我們該怎麼做呢？沒錯，我們要日以繼夜地奮鬥、投注所有心力，只求推翻人類！這就是我要傳達給你們的訊息，同志們，抗爭！我不知道抗爭什麼時候會開始，也許一週之內，或者百年之間，但是我知道正義遲早會到來，我非常確定，就像我看得到腳下的稻草一般。同志們，用你們剩下的短暫生命好好看著！還有，最重要的是，將我的訊息傳達給你們的後代，這樣他們才會持續地奮鬥下去，直到成功為止。

「還有，同志們，要記住，你們的決心絕對不能動搖，絕不能被任何論點導向歧途，絕不要聽信人類和動物共享利益、彼此共榮這種話，這些都是謊言。人類只會追求自己的利益，不顧其他生物。在這場抗爭中，我們動物要彼此緊密團結、合作無間。所有人類都是敵人，所有動物都是同志。」

此時穀倉內一陣譁然，老少校在演講時，四隻大老鼠從洞裡爬出來，蹲坐著聽。狗意外發現老鼠，結果老鼠一溜煙鑽進洞裡保住小命。老少校舉起蹄子要大家安靜：

「同志們，」他說：「這裡有個問題必須釐清。像是老鼠、兔子這類野生動物，算是我們的朋友還是敵人？讓我們投票表決吧，我在此聚會中提出這個問題：老鼠是同志嗎？」

表決立即展開，絕大多數動物都同意將老鼠當作同志，只有三條狗及一隻貓投下四張反對票，後來大家才發現他們其實兩邊都投。老少校繼續說道：

「我還有一些話要講，且容我重申，永遠記住要敵視人類及其所作所為，這是你們的責任。以兩隻腳走路的都是敵人，以四隻腳走路或是有翅膀的都是朋友。還有，你們也要記住，在對抗人類時不可愈來愈像人類，就算你們打倒他們了也不能染上他們的惡習。所有動物都不能住在屋子裡、睡在床上、穿衣服、喝酒、抽菸、碰錢，或者做買賣。人類所有的習慣都是有害的，最重要的是，動物不准欺壓同類，不管是強是弱、聰明或笨拙，我們情同兄弟。動物不准殺害其他動物，所有動物一律平等。

「現在，同志們，我要跟你們說我昨晚所做的夢，我實在不知如何描述，這個夢是關於人類消失以後的世界，而且讓我想起一件早已遺忘的事情。許多年前，當我還是頭小豬時，我的母親跟其他母豬曾經唱過一首老歌，但她們只記得旋律和開頭三個字。我從還是小豬的時候就知道這旋律了，但有好長一段時間不曾去回想。昨晚，這旋律在我的夢中再度響起，連歌詞也一併浮現。我敢肯定，這些歌詞曾

在很久以前的動物口中傳唱，但好幾世代以來為大家所遺忘。同志們，我現在就為你們唱這首歌，我老了，嗓子啞了，但是我教你們怎麼唱以後，你們自己可以唱得更好聽。這首歌叫做〈英格蘭之獸〉。」

老少校清了清喉嚨，唱起歌來。他的嗓子就像他說的一樣沙啞，但唱得算是不錯了，這首歌的旋律激昂，大概介於〈克萊門泰〉（Clementine）跟〈蟑螂歌〉（La Cucuracha）1之間。歌詞如下：

英格蘭之獸，愛爾蘭之獸，

萬國眾地之獸，

聽我悅人音信，

大好未來良佳訊。

那天遲早會到來，

人類暴政終垮臺，

豐饒土地英格蘭，

只見眾獸足跡踩。

鼻頭環勾不復見，

背上挽具不再配，

口銜靴刺永蒙鏽，

無情長鞭絕咻鳴。

超乎想像之富饒，

小麥與大麥，燕麥與乾草，

苜蓿、豆類與甜菜，

屆時吾等囊中包。

明光普照英格蘭，

水更純，

風更輕，

解放時日之情景。

為了這天須努力，

為求成功死不計，

乳牛及馬，鵝及火雞，

皆為自由盡心力。

英格蘭之獸，愛爾蘭之獸，

萬國眾地之獸，

用心傾聽，傳我音信，

大好未來將來臨。

這首歌讓動物們無比激動，老少校還有一小段沒唱完，他們就自顧自哼起來了。即使最笨的動物也已經記得旋律和零星歌詞，至於豬和狗這些比較聰明的動物，幾分鐘內已將整首歌默記在心。大家演練了幾次後齊聲高唱，完美的合唱聲響遍農莊，牛哞狗吠，羊啼馬嘶，鴨子呱呱應和。他們非常喜歡這首歌，從頭到尾連續唱了五次，要不是被打斷，搞不好會唱上一整晚。

可惜的是，這場騷動吵醒瓊斯先生，他從床上一躍而下，以為院子裡有隻狐狸，因此抓起總是擱在臥室角落的槍，一發六號子彈旋即射入黑暗之中，子彈散粒鑽進穀倉牆內，聚會因而匆匆解散。動物們紛紛溜回自己睡覺的地方，家禽跳上枝頭，家畜俯臥稻草之中，沒多久，所有動物都進入了夢鄉。

1　兩首歌皆為西方民謠，前者旋律緩慢，後者輕快。



## Chapter 2


THREE NIGHTS LATER old Major died peacefully in his sleep. His body was buried at the foot of the orchard.

This was early in March. During the next three months there was much secret activity. Major's speech had given to the more intelligent animals on the farm a completely new outlook on life. They did not know when the Rebellion predicted by Major would take place, they had no reason for thinking that it would be within their own lifetime, but they saw clearly that it was their duty to prepare for it. The work of teaching and organising the others fell naturally upon the pigs, who were generally recognised as being the cleverest of the animals. Preeminent among the pigs were two young boars named Snowball and Napoleon, whom Mr. Jones was breeding up for sale. Napoleon was a large, rather fierce-looking Berkshire boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way. Snowball was a more vivacious pig than Napoleon, quicker in speech and more inventive, but was not considered to have the same depth of character. All the other male pigs on the farm were porkers. The best known among them was a small fat pig named Squealer, with very round cheeks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements, and a shrill voice. He was a brilliant talker, and when he was arguing some difficult point he had a way of skipping from side to side and whisking his tail which was somehow very persuasive. The others said of Squealer that he could turn black into white.

These three had elaborated old Major's teachings into a complete system of thought, to which they gave the name of Animalism. Several nights a week, after Mr. Jones was asleep, they held secret meetings in the barn and expounded the principles of Animalism to the others. At the beginning they met with much stupidity and apathy. Some of the animals talked of the duty of loyalty to Mr. Jones, whom they referred to as "Master," or made elementary remarks such as "Mr. Jones feeds us. If he were gone, we should starve to death." Others asked such questions as "Why should we care what happens after we are dead?" or "If this Rebellion is to happen anyway, what difference does it make whether we work for it or not?" and the pigs had great difficulty in making them see that this was contrary to the spirit of Animalism. The stupidest questions of all were asked by Mollie, the white mare. The very first question she asked Snowball was: "Will there still be sugar after the Rebellion?"

"No," said Snowball firmly. "We have no means of making sugar on this farm. Besides, you do not need sugar. You will have all the oats and hay you want."

"And shall I still be allowed to wear ribbons in my mane?" asked Mollie.

"Comrade," said Snowball, "those ribbons that you are so devoted to are the badge of slavery. Can you not understand that liberty is worth more than ribbons?"

Mollie agreed, but she did not sound very convinced.

The pigs had an even harder struggle to counteract the lies put about by Moses, the tame raven. Moses, who was Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker. He claimed to know of the existence of a mysterious country called Sugarcandy Mountain, to which all animals went when they died. It was situated somewhere up in the sky, a little distance beyond the clouds, Moses said. In Sugarcandy Mountain it was Sunday seven days a week, clover was in season all the year round, and lump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges. The animals hated Moses because he told tales and did no work, but some of them believed in Sugarcandy Mountain, and the pigs had to argue very hard to persuade them that there was no such place.

Their most faithful disciples were the two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover. These two had great difficulty in thinking anything out for themselves, but having once accepted the pigs as their teachers, they absorbed everything that they were told, and passed it on to the other animals by simple arguments. They were unfailing in their attendance at the secret meetings in the barn, and led the singing of "Beasts of England," with which the meetings always ended.

Now, as it turned out, the Rebellion was achieved much earlier and more easily than anyone had expected. In past years Mr. Jones, although a hard master, had been a capable farmer, but of late he had fallen on evil days. He had become much disheartened after losing money in a lawsuit, and had taken to drinking more than was good for him. For whole days at a time he would lounge in his Windsor chair in the kitchen, reading the newspapers, drinking, and occasionally feeding Moses on crusts of bread soaked in beer. His men were idle and dishonest, the fields were full of weeds, the buildings wanted roofing, the hedges were neglected, and the animals were underfed.

June came and the hay was almost ready for cutting. On Midsummer's Eve, which was a Saturday, Mr. Jones went into Willingdon and got so drunk at the Red Lion that he did not come back till midday on Sunday The men had milked the cows in the early morning and then had gone out rabbiting, without bothering to feed the animals. When Mr. Jones got back he immediately went to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the News of the World over his face, so that when evening came, the animals were still unfed. At last they could stand it no longer. One of the cows broke in the door of the store-shed with her horns and all the animals began to help themselves from the bins. It was just then that Mr. Jones woke up. The next moment he and his four men were in the store-shed with whips in their hands, lashing out in all directions. This was more than the hungry animals could bear. With one accord, though nothing of the kind had been planned beforehand, they flung themselves upon their tormentors. Jones and his men suddenly found themselves being butted and kicked from all sides. The situation was quite out of their control. They had never seen animals behave like this before, and this sudden uprising of creatures whom they were used to thrashing and maltreating just as they chose, frightened them almost out of their wits. After only a moment or two they gave up trying to defend themselves and took to their heels. A minute later all five of them were in full flight down the cart-track that led to the main road, with the animals pursuing them in triumph.

Mrs. Jones looked out of the bedroom window, saw what was happening, hurriedly flung a few possessions into a carpet bag, and slipped out of the farm by another way. Moses sprang off his perch and flapped after her, croaking loudly. Meanwhile the animals had chased Jones and his men out on to the road and slammed the five-barred gate behind them. And so, almost before they knew what was happening, the Rebellion had been successfully carried through: Jones was expelled, and the Manor Farm was theirs.

For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good fortune. Their first act was to gallop in a body right round the boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being was hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm buildings to wipe out the last traces of Jones's hated reign. The harness-room at the end of the stables was broken open; the bits, the nose-rings, the dog-chains, the cruel knives with which Mr. Jones had been used to castrate the pigs and lambs, were all flung down the well. The reins, the halters, the blinkers, the degrading nose-bags, were thrown on to the rubbish fire which was burning in the yard. So were the whips. All the animals capered with joy when they saw the whips going up in flames. Snowball also threw on to the fire the ribbons with which the horses' manes and tails had usually been decorated on market days.

"Ribbons," he said, "should be considered as clothes, which are the mark of a human being. All animals should go naked."

When Boxer heard this he fetched the small straw hat which he wore in summer to keep the flies out of his ears, and flung it on to the fire with the rest.

In a very little while the animals had destroyed everything that reminded them of Mr. Jones. Napoleon then led them back to the store-shed and served out a double ration of corn to everybody, with two biscuits for each dog. Then they sang "Beasts of England" from end to end seven times running, and after that they settled down for the night and slept as they had never slept before.

But they woke at dawn as usual, and suddenly remembering the glorious thing that had happened, they all raced out into the pasture together. A little way down the pasture there was a knoll that commanded a view of most of the farm. The animals rushed to the top of it and gazed round them in the clear morning light. Yes, it was theirs—everything that they could see was theirs! In the ecstasy of that thought they gambolled round and round, they hurled themselves into the air in great leaps of excitement. They rolled in the dew, they cropped mouthfuls of the sweet summer grass, they kicked up clods of the black earth and snuffed its rich scent. Then they made a tour of inspection of the whole farm and surveyed with speechless admiration the ploughland, the hayfield, the orchard, the pool, the spinney. It was as though they had never seen these things before, and even now they could hardly believe that it was all their own.

Then they filed back to the farm buildings and halted in silence outside the door of the farmhouse. That was theirs too, but they were frightened to go inside. After a moment, however, Snowball and Napoleon butted the door open with their shoulders and the animals entered in single file, walking with the utmost care for fear of disturbing anything. They tiptoed from room to room, afraid to speak above a whisper and gazing with a kind of awe at the unbelievable luxury, at the beds with their feather mattresses, the looking-glasses, the horsehair sofa, the Brussels carpet, the lithograph of Queen Victoria over the drawing-room mantelpiece. They were just coming down the stairs when Mollie was discovered to be missing. Going back, the others found that she had remained behind in the best bedroom. She had taken a piece of blue ribbon from Mrs. Jones's dressing-table, and was holding it against her shoulder and admiring herself in the glass in a very foolish manner. The others reproached her sharply, and they went outside. Some hams hanging in the kitchen were taken out for burial, and the barrel of beer in the scullery was stove in with a kick from Boxer's hoof, otherwise nothing in the house was touched. A unanimous resolution was passed on the spot that the farmhouse should be preserved as a museum. All were agreed that no animal must ever live there.

The animals had their breakfast, and then Snowball and Napoleon called them together again.

"Comrades," said Snowball, "it is half-past six and we have a long day before us. Today we begin the hay harvest. But there is another matter that must be attended to first."

The pigs now revealed that during the past three months they had taught themselves to read and write from an old spelling book which had belonged to Mr. Jones's children and which had been thrown on the rubbish heap. Napoleon sent for pots of black and white paint and led the way down to the five-barred gate that gave on to the main road. Then Snowball (for it was Snowball who was best at writing) took a brush between the two knuckles of his trotter, painted out MANOR FARM from the top bar of the gate and in its place painted ANIMAL FARM. This was to be the name of the farm from now onwards. After this they went back to the farm buildings, where Snowball and Napoleon sent for a ladder which they caused to be set against the end wall of the big barn. They explained that by their studies of the past three months the pigs had succeeded in reducing the principles of Animalism to Seven Commandments. These Seven Commandments would now be inscribed on the wall; they would form an unalterable law by which all the animals on Animal Farm must live for ever after. With some difficulty (for it is not easy for a pig to balance himself on a ladder) Snowball climbed up and set to work, with Squealer a few rungs below him holding the paint-pot. The Commandments were written on the tarred wall in great white letters that could be read thirty yards away. They ran thus:

THE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS

1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.

2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.

3. No animal shall wear clothes.

4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.

5. No animal shall drink alcohol.

6. No animal shall kill any other animal.

7. All animals are equal.



It was very neatly written, and except that "friend" was written "freind" and one of the "S's" was the wrong way round, the spelling was correct all the way through. Snowball read it aloud for the benefit of the others. All the animals nodded in complete agreement, and the cleverer ones at once began to learn the Commandments by heart.

"Now, comrades," cried Snowball, throwing down the paintbrush, "to the hayfield! Let us make it a point of honour to get in the harvest more quickly than Jones and his men could do."

But at this moment the three cows, who had seemed uneasy for some time past, set up a loud lowing. They had not been milked for twenty-four hours, and their udders were almost bursting. After a little thought, the pigs sent for buckets and milked the cows fairly successfully, their trotters being well adapted to this task. Soon there were five buckets of frothing creamy milk at which many of the animals looked with considerable interest.

"What is going to happen to all that milk?" said someone.

"Jones used sometimes to mix some of it in our mash," said one of the hens.

"Never mind the milk, comrades!" cried Napoleon, placing himself in front of the buckets. "That will be attended to. The harvest is more important. Comrade Snowball will lead the way. I shall follow in a few minutes. Forward, comrades! The hay is waiting."

So the animals trooped down to the hayfield to begin the harvest, and when they came back in the evening it was noticed that the milk had disappeared.

## 第 2 章

過了三晚，老少校在睡夢中安詳去世，遺體葬在果園一隅，靠近山腳處。

這時候是三月初，接下來的三個月裡，農莊內進行著一場極為機密的行動。老少校一席話讓較有智慧的動物對活著產生嶄新的看法，他們不知道老少校預言的抗爭何時來臨，也沒理由認為自己在有生之年看得到，但他們清楚自己有責任為抗爭作準備。教導、組織其他動物的任務自然落在豬的身上，大家都認為他們是最聰明的動物。在豬群中，最有本事的要屬雪球和拿破崙這兩頭瓊斯先生原本打算養來賣的年輕種豬。拿破崙是農莊內唯一一隻波克夏種豬，身形巨大、長相凶狠、不擅言詞而且大家都知道他喜歡為所欲為。與拿破崙相比，雪球顯得較為活潑，他口齒伶俐、見解獨到，但個人色彩沒有拿破崙鮮明。農莊內其他豬隻都是肉豬，其中最有名的是名為尖叫者的小胖豬，他臉頰豐滿、雙眼閃爍、動作靈巧且聲音尖銳。尖叫者能言善道，在爭辯一些棘手的議題時，總習慣跳來蹦去並甩動尾巴，這動作莫名地具說服力，其他動物都說尖叫者能把黑的說成白的。

這三頭豬將老少校的教誨仔細整理成一套完整的思想系統，稱之為動物主義。他們一週總會花上好幾晚，趁瓊斯先生入睡時在穀倉內舉行祕密聚會，向其他動物闡述動物主義的信條。剛開始動物們不是聽不懂就是沒興趣，有些動物會大談對瓊斯先生應有的忠誠，或者把話題轉到基本面上，例如「瓊斯先生餵養我們，如果他不見了，我們會餓死」。對他們來說，瓊斯先生是「主人」。有些動物會問其他問題，像是「我們為什麼要去管死後才會發生的事情？」或者「如果抗爭一定會發生，我們出力與否有什麼差別？」豬隻們實在難以讓他們了解這與動物主義的精神相悖。其中最愚蠢的問題出自白色母馬莫莉之口，她問雪球的第一個問題是：「抗爭以後還會有糖吃嗎？」

「不會，」雪球肯定地說：「農莊裡沒有製糖機器。但是你到時也不需要糖了，你可以隨意享用所有的燕麥和乾草。」

「那我還可以在鬃毛上綁紅緞帶嗎？」莫莉問。

「同志，」雪球說：「你所著迷的緞帶是奴役的象徵，你難道不了解自由比緞帶更可貴嗎？」

莫莉表示同意，但聽起來不太服氣。

瓊斯先生養了隻特殊的寵物，就是烏鴉摩西。他是間諜，喜歡四處造謠，而且能言善道，對豬群來說，摩西所散布的不實說法更難處理。他聲稱有個神祕的地方叫糖果山，動物死後全會去那裡。他說，糖果山在天上雲間，山中一週都是星期天，苜蓿一年四季皆可見，籬笆還會長出糖塊和亞麻仁餅。摩西只會講故事從不做事，動物都很討厭他。但有些動物卻相信糖果山的確存在，所以豬隻們得要費盡唇舌讓他們明白世界上沒有這樣的地方。

豬隻們最忠誠的信徒是拳擊手與幸運草這兩匹拉車馬，他們非常拙於思考，在將豬視為導師之後，便全盤接收他們的一切想法，並以簡單的用語轉述給其他動物聽。這兩匹馬按時出席穀倉密會，還帶頭唱聚會末尾必唱的〈英格蘭之獸〉。

從結果來看，抗爭從開始到成功過程既快又輕鬆，出乎大家預料。過去幾年來，雖然瓊斯先生一直是個苛刻的主人，但也是名能幹的農夫，可是這陣子卻在走楣運，自從官司打輸賠了一筆錢後，瓊斯先生灰心喪志、常常酗酒。他會一連幾天窩在廚房的高背木椅上看報紙、喝酒，有時還拿沾過啤酒的麵包屑餵摩西。他的手下既懶散又不誠實，農田裡滿地雜草，倉舍屋頂年久失修，籬笆乏人整理，動物未能飽食。

到了六月，即將進入乾草收割期，今年仲夏夜為星期六，瓊斯先生在威靈頓的紅獅酒吧喝得酩酊大醉，隔天中午才回到農莊。他的手下一大早替牛擠過奶就出門獵兔去，完全忘記要餵動物。瓊斯先生回到家便睡倒在客廳沙發上，臉上還蓋著《世界新聞報》。動物們一直到晚上都沒進食，最後受不了了，有隻牛用角撞開貯糧庫大門，大家衝進去各自找食物吃。說時遲那時快，瓊斯先生突然驚醒，他和四名手下趕到貯糧庫，手持皮鞭四處亂抽。飢餓的動物忍無可忍，在沒有事先計畫的情況下不約而同撲向施虐者。來自四面八方的頭頂腳踢讓瓊斯及其手下意識到局面已經失控，他們從沒看過動物這樣子，過去任人鞭打虐待的牲畜轉眼發狂，嚇得這群人魂不附體。沒多久，他們放棄抵抗，拔腿就逃，沿著車道飛奔至大馬路上，動物們得意洋洋地在後頭追趕。

瓊斯太太從臥室窗戶向外望，看見底下發生的事情，急忙將一些家當往手提袋裡塞，從另一條路倉皇逃離農莊。而摩西則大聲地呱呱叫著，拍動翅膀飛離棲木跟在她身後。此時，動物們將瓊斯及其手下驅逐至大馬路上，一把甩上柵門。就這樣，在他們回神之前，抗爭便已成功。瓊斯被趕走，農莊屬於他們了。

最初幾分鐘，動物們簡直無法相信運氣會這麼好，他們做的第一件事是集體繞農莊跑一圈，彷彿是在確認沒人躲在莊內。然後他們回到倉舍，將瓊斯留下的可恨痕跡全部清除。動物們撞破馬廄內的農具房，口銜、鼻環、狗鍊以及瓊斯先生用來替豬羊去勢的殘忍利刃全被扔到井底。韁繩、籠頭、眼罩以及羞辱馬的飼料袋通通被丟進院子裡的垃圾火堆中，其中也包括鞭子。看著火舌吞沒鞭子，動物們歡喜雀躍。瓊斯在市集日總會在馬兒的鬃毛及尾巴繫上緞帶，這些也被雪球一併扔進火裡。

雪球說：「我們應該將緞帶看作衣服，這是人類的象徵，所有動物都該光著身子。」

聽完雪球這麼講，拳擊手咬起夏天戴來防止蒼蠅在耳邊亂飛的小草帽，拋進火裡一起燒了。

不一會兒，動物們摧毀所有和瓊斯先生有關的東西。拿破崙帶領大家回到貯糧庫，發給他們兩倍的穀物，每條狗也分到兩塊餅乾。接著他們唱起〈英格蘭之獸〉，從頭到尾一共唱了七次。隨後天色已晚，大家稍作休息便進入夢鄉，睡了場前所未有的好覺。

不過，動物們依舊在黎明時醒來，猛然想起昨天的光榮事蹟，全都往牧場跑。牧場附近有座小山丘能眺望整座農莊，大夥兒衝到那上面，在清澈的晨光中俯視四周。沒錯，農莊是他們的了，從這裡舉目所及皆為他們所有！這念頭讓動物們欣喜若狂地蹦來蹦去，興奮得一跳就跳到半空中。動物們在露濕草地上打滾，滿口香甜的夏日青草，還一腳踢起黑色土壤，嗅聞濃郁的土香。然後，他們在農莊各處巡視，看著耕地、草地、果園、水塘和樹叢，欽歎得說不出話來，彷彿從未見過眼前景象。直到現在，動物們都還不敢相信，這些已全歸自己所有。

動物們魚貫打道回府，卻在農舍大門前默立良久，這裡也屬於他們了，但他們不敢進去。過一會兒，雪球和拿破崙以肩膀撞開大門，讓動物逐一入內，大家小心翼翼，生怕驚動什麼似地躡手躡腳察看每個房間，說起話來也輕聲細語，大家帶著敬畏的眼神凝視如此難以置信的氣派景象，映入眼簾的有羽絨床鋪、鏡子、馬鬃沙發、布魯塞爾地毯以及客廳壁爐上端的維多利亞女王平版畫像。下樓時，大家發現莫莉不見蹤影，回頭一找，才發現她待在最奢華的臥室裡。莫莉從瓊斯太太的梳妝台上銜來一條藍色緞帶擱在肩上，站到鏡子前顧影弄姿，舉止十分愚蠢。其他動物厲聲斥責她，之後便一起離開臥室。廚房裡掛了幾串火腿，動物們全拿出去埋了，貯物室內的酒桶也被拳擊手的蹄子踹破一個洞，除此之外，屋內其他東西都沒被動過。動物們當場無異議通過，保留農舍作為博物館，而且任何動物都不准住在這裡。

吃完了早餐，雪球和拿破崙把動物們叫到跟前。

「同志們，」雪球說：「現在是六點半，接下來將是漫長的一天，我們要收割乾草，但在這之前還有一件事情得先處理。」

豬表示，他們從垃圾堆中撿來一本老舊的拼字練習簿，是瓊斯小孩不要的，結果成了豬隻們過去三個月來學習閱讀寫字的工具。拿破崙要動物拿來黑色和白色油漆，然後帶領大家到通往大馬路的柵門前。雪球（因為他最會寫字）前蹄拿起刷子，塗掉柵門最上方橫木的「曼諾農莊」四個大字，改成「動物農莊」，作為這座農莊今後的名稱。完成後，他們回到倉舍，雪球與拿破崙要動物搬來梯子，靠在大穀倉牆邊。他們解釋說，根據過去三個月的鑽研，豬群成功將動物主義的原則歸納成七誡，這七誡現在要寫在牆上，當作動物農莊內所有動物必須遵從的不變律法。雪球費了一番工夫（因為要豬在梯子上保持平衡是件難事）才爬上梯子開始作業，尖叫者則在雪球下方托著油漆罐。在塗滿瀝青的牆壁上，雪球以斗大的白色字體寫下七誡，就算在三十尺外都看得見。此七誡為：

一、雙足行走者皆為敵人；

二、四足行走或者具翅膀者皆為朋友；

三、不可穿衣；

四、不可睡於床上；

五、不可飲酒；

六、不可殺害其他同類；

七、動物一律平等。

牆上字跡工整，只是「朋友」寫成了「明友」，還有個「不」字筆劃錯誤，除此之外都正確無誤。雪球為其他動物大聲念出七誡，大家點頭如搗蒜，完全同意這些內容，比較聰明的動物更立刻將這些誡律默記起來。

「現在，同志們，」雪球丟下刷子高喊著：「到乾草地去吧！我們要收割得比瓊斯和他的手下快，當作是種成就。」

就在此時，三頭早已感到不適的牛放聲哞叫，已有一整天沒人幫她們擠奶了，她們的乳房飽漲欲裂。豬隻們想了一會兒，要其他動物取來桶子，由豬隻動手，相當順利地為牛擠出奶來，他們的蹄子很能適應這種差事。過沒多久，豬擠出五桶還帶著泡沫的鮮奶，吸引許多動物帶有幾分覬覦的目光。

「這些牛奶該怎麼處理？」有隻動物問道。

「瓊斯有時會加一些在我們飼料裡。」一隻母雞說。

「同志們，不要管這些牛奶！」拿破崙站在五桶牛奶前面叫道：「有動物會負責處理的，收割乾草比較重要，雪球同志會帶路，我幾分鐘後就到。同志們，前進！乾草在等著我們。」

於是動物們成群結隊走向乾草地，展開收割工作。晚上回到倉舍時，卻發現牛奶已經消失了。

## Chapter 3

HOW THEY TOILED and sweated to get the hay in! But their efforts were rewarded, for the harvest was an even bigger success than they had hoped.

Sometimes the work was hard; the implements had been designed for human beings and not for animals, and it was a great drawback that no animal was able to use any tool that involved standing on his hind legs. But the pigs were so clever that they could think of a way round every difficulty. As for the horses, they knew every inch of the field, and in fact understood the business of mowing and raking far better than Jones and his men had ever done. The pigs did not actually work, but directed and supervised the others. With their superior knowledge it was natural that they should assume the leadership. Boxer and Clover would harness themselves to the cutter or the horse-rake (no bits or reins were needed in these days, of course) and tramp steadily round and round the field with a pig walking behind and calling out "Gee up, comrade!" or "Whoa back, comrade!" as the case might be. And every animal down to the humblest worked at turning the hay and gathering it. Even the ducks and hens toiled to and fro all day in the sun, carrying tiny wisps of hay in their beaks. In the end they finished the harvest in two days' less time than it had usually taken Jones and his men. Moreover, it was the biggest harvest that the farm had ever seen. There was no wastage whatever; the hens and ducks with their sharp eyes had gathered up the very last stalk. And not an animal on the farm had stolen so much as a mouthful.

All through that summer the work of the farm went like clockwork. The animals were happy as they had never conceived it possible to be. Every mouthful of food was an acute positive pleasure, now that it was truly their own food, produced by themselves and for themselves, not doled out to them by a grudging master. With the worthless parasitical human beings gone, there was more for everyone to eat. There was more leisure too, inexperienced though the animals were. They met with many difficulties—for instance, later in the year, when they harvested the corn, they had to tread it out in the ancient style and blow away the chaff with their breath, since the farm possessed no threshing machine—but the pigs with their cleverness and Boxer with his tremendous muscles always pulled them through. Boxer was the admiration of everybody. He had been a hard worker even in Jones's time, but now he seemed more like three horses than one; there were days when the entire work of the farm seemed to rest on his mighty shoulders. From morning to night he was pushing and pulling, always at the spot where the work was hardest. He had made an arrangement with one of the cockerels to call him in the mornings half an hour earlier than anyone else, and would put in some volunteer labour at whatever seemed to be most needed, before the regular day's work began. His answer to every problem, every setback, was "I will work harder!"—which he had adopted as his personal motto.

But everyone worked according to his capacity. The hens and ducks, for instance, saved five bushels of corn at the harvest by gathering up the stray grains. Nobody stole, nobody grumbled over his rations, the quarrelling and biting and jealousy which had been normal features of life in the old days had almost disappeared. Nobody shirked—or almost nobody. Mollie, it was true, was not good at getting up in the mornings, and had a way of leaving work early on the ground that there was a stone in her hoof. And the behaviour of the cat was somewhat peculiar. It was soon noticed that when there was work to be done the cat could never be found. She would vanish for hours on end, and then reappear at meal-times, or in the evening after work was over, as though nothing had happened. But she always made such excellent excuses, and purred so affectionately, that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions. Old Benjamin, the donkey, seemed quite unchanged since the Rebellion. He did his work in the same slow obstinate way as he had done it in Jones's time, never shirking and never volunteering for extra work either. About the Rebellion and its results he would express no opinion. When asked whether he was not happier now that Jones was gone, he would say only "Donkeys live a long time. None of you has ever seen a dead donkey," and the others had to be content with this cryptic answer.

On Sundays there was no work. Breakfast was an hour later than usual, and after breakfast there was a ceremony which was observed every week without fail. First came the hoisting of the flag. Snowball had found in the harness-room an old green tablecloth of Mrs. Jones's and had painted on it a hoof and a horn in white. This was run up the flagstaff in the farmhouse garden every Sunday morning. The flag was green, Snowball explained, to represent the green fields of England, while the hoof and horn signified the Republic of the Animals which would arise when the human race had been finally overthrown. After the hoisting of the flag all the animals trooped into the big barn for a general assembly which was known as the Meeting. Here the work of the coming week was planned out and resolutions were put forward and debated. It was always the pigs who put forward the resolutions. The other animals understood how to vote, but could never think of any resolutions of their own. Snowball and Napoleon were by far the most active in the debates. But it was noticed that these two were never in agreement: whatever suggestion either of them made, the other could be counted on to oppose it. Even when it was resolved—a thing no one could object to in itself—to set aside the small paddock behind the orchard as a home of rest for animals who were past work, there was a stormy debate over the correct retiring age for each class of animal. The Meeting always ended with the singing of "Beasts of England, and the afternoon was given up to recreation.

The pigs had set aside the harness-room as a headquarters for themselves. Here, in the evenings, they studied blacksmithing, carpentering, and other necessary arts from books which they had brought out of the farmhouse. Snowball also busied himself with organising the other animals into What he called Animal Committees. He was indefatigable at this. He formed the Egg Production; Committee for the hens, the Clean Tails League for the cows, the Wild Comrades' Re-education Committee (the object of this was to tame the rats and rabbits), the Whiter Wool Movement for the sheep, and various others, besides instituting classes in reading and writing. On the whole, these projects were a failure. The attempt to tame the wild creatures, for instance, broke down almost immediately. They continued to behave very much as before, and when treated with generosity, simply took advantage of it. The cat joined the Re-education Committee and was very active in it for some days. She was seen one day sitting on a roof and talking to some sparrows who were just out of her reach. She was telling them that all animals were now comrades and that any sparrow who chose could come and perch on her paw; but the sparrows kept their distance.

The reading and writing classes, however, were a great success. By the autumn almost every animal on the farm was literate in some degree.

As for the pigs, they could already read and write perfectly. The dogs learned to read fairly well, but were not interested in reading anything except the Seven Commandments. Muriel, the goat, could read somewhat better than the dogs, and sometimes used to read to the others in the evenings from scraps of newspaper which she found on the rubbish heap. Benjamin could read as well as any pig, but never exercised his faculty. So far as he knew, he said, there was nothing worth reading. Clover learnt the whole alphabet, but could not put words together. Boxer could not get beyond the letter D. He would trace out A, B, C, D, in the dust with his great hoof, and then would stand staring at the letters with his ears back, sometimes shaking his forelock, trying with all his might to remember what came next and never succeeding. On several occasions, indeed, he did learn E, F, G, H, but by the time he knew them, it was always discovered that he had forgotten A, B, C, and D. Finally he decided to be content with the first four letters, and used to write them out once or twice every day to refresh his memory. Mollie refused to learn any but the six letters which spelt her own name. She would form these very neatly out of pieces of twig, and would then decorate them with a flower or two and walk round them admiring them.

**None of the other animals on the farm could get further than the letter A. It was also found that the stupider animals, such as the sheep, hens, and ducks, were unable to learn the Seven Commandments by heart. After much thought Snowball declared that the Seven Commandments could in effect be reduced to a single maxim, namely: "Four legs good, two legs bad." This, he said, contained the essential principle of Animalism. Whoever had thoroughly grasped it would be safe from human influences. The birds at first objected, since it seemed to them that they also had two legs, but Snowball proved to them that this was not so.**

"A bird's wing, comrades," he said, "is an organ of propulsion and not of manipulation. It should therefore be regarded as a leg. The distinguishing mark of man is the hand, the instrument with which he does all his mischief."

The birds did not understand Snowball's long words, but they accepted his explanation, and all the humbler animals set to work to learn the new maxim by heart. FOUR LEGS GOOD, TWO LEGS BAD, was inscribed on the end wall of the barn, above the Seven Commandments and in bigger letters. When they had once got it by heart, the sheep developed a great liking for this maxim, and often as they lay in the field they would all start bleating "Four legs good, two legs bad! Four legs good, two legs bad!" and keep it up for hours on end, never growing tired of it.

Napoleon took no interest in Snowball's committees. He said that the education of the young was more important than anything that could be done for those who were already grown up. It happened that Jessie and Bluebell had both whelped soon after the hay harvest, giving birth between them to nine sturdy puppies. As soon as they were weaned, Napoleon took them away from their mothers, saying that he would make himself responsible for their education. He took them up into a loft which could only be reached by a ladder from the harness-room, and there kept them in such seclusion that the rest of the farm soon forgot their existence.

The mystery of where the milk went to was soon cleared up. It was mixed every day into the pigs' mash. The early apples were now ripening, and the grass of the orchard was littered with windfalls. The animals had assumed as a matter of course that these would be shared out equally; one day, however, the order went forth that all the windfalls were to be collected and brought to the harness-room for the use of the pigs. At this some of the other animals murmured, but it was no use. All the pigs were in full agreement on this point, even Snowball and Napoleon. Squealer was sent to make the necessary explanations to the others.

"Comrades!" he cried. "You do not imagine, I hope, that we pigs are doing this in a spirit of selfishness and privilege? Many of us actually dislike milk and apples. I dislike them myself. Our sole object in taking these things is to preserve our health. Milk and apples (this has been proved by Science, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary to the well-being of a pig. We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organisation of this farm depend on us. Day and night we are watching over your welfare. It is for your sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples. Do you know what would happen if we pigs failed in our duty? Jones would come back! Yes. Jones would come back! Surely, comrades," cried Squealer almost pleadingly, skipping from side to side and whisking his tail, "surely there is no one among you who wants to see Jones come back?"

Now if there was one thing that the animals were completely certain of, it was that they did not want Jones back. When it was put to them in this light, they had no more to say. The importance of keeping the pigs in good health was all too obvious. So it was agreed without further argument that the milk and the windfall apples (and also the main crop of apples when they ripened) should be reserved for the pigs alone.

## 第 3 章

動物們是多麼辛勤地在收割乾草啊！一切努力都是值得的，收成比預期還可觀。

工作有時比較費勁，畢竟那些農具是設計給人用的，而非動物。最讓人傷腦筋的是，沒有動物能使用僅靠兩隻後腳站立來操作的工具。然而，在面對難題時，聰明的豬總能找出解決之道。至於那些馬，他們對於田裡的事情瞭若指掌，事實上，還比瓊斯及其手下更清楚割草耙地的要訣。豬其實不用工作，主要負責指揮監督其他動物，他們學識較為淵博，理當作為領導人物。拳擊手和幸運草則負責拉割草機或者馬拉耙（現在當然不需要口銜、馬韁了），步伐平穩地在田裡來回作業，身旁還會有隻豬隨行，視情況喊著「同志，前進！」或者「同志，後退！」所有動物不分尊卑一起收集乾草，就連母雞和鴨也用嘴啣，在太陽底下往來運送。最後，收成完畢，他們的速度整整比瓊斯先生及其手下快了兩天！這還是農莊歷來收成最豐碩的一次，因為母雞與鴨眼力敏銳，一根乾草都不放過，所以田裡沒有半點漏收之成。此外，動物們也不敢偷吃這些乾草半口。

那年夏天，動物們按時處理各項農事，像這種幸福日子，他們以前想都沒想過。每口食物皆帶來無比歡愉，因為這真真正正是自己的食物了。他們自給自足，不需吝嗇主人施捨。寄生蟲般的無用人類遭到驅逐後，大家得到更多食物，空閒時間也增加了，這是動物們從未有過的經驗。但他們也碰到許多困難，比方說，由於農莊內沒有打榖機，所以在年底採收完穀物後，動物們得依循古法踩踏穀子，再吹走榖殼。碰到麻煩時，足智多謀的豬和力大無窮的拳擊手總能帶大家度過難關。拳擊手是所有動物仰慕的對象，他從瓊斯還在時就很勤奮，現在更是能完成三匹馬的工作，有時還一肩扛下所有差事。拳擊手從早到晚推這拉那，最棘手的部分總是由他處理，他還要一隻小公雞每天早半小時叫醒他，因為他自願在每天工作開始前完成一些急待處理的事情。每次碰到問題或挫折，他的回答都是「我要更努力」，這句話儼然成為他的座右銘了。

每隻動物各展其才，像母雞和鴨就幫忙拾回五蒲式耳2的穀子，大家不偷也不對配給量有所抱怨，以往司空見慣的爭吵、互咬和嫉妒幾乎消失，而且動物們無一（或者該說鮮少）偷懶。不過，有些動物就是貪圖安逸，莫莉不善於早起，還會拿石頭卡在蹄子裡當藉口提早結束工作。貓的舉止也有點詭異，大家發現一有工作貓就不見蹤影。她會索性失蹤幾小時，用餐時段或者晚上工作結束後才若無其事地再度現身。但她總有很棒的藉口，配上輕柔的嗚叫聲，讓動物們不得不相信她動機純良。老班傑明這頭驢子在抗爭之後似乎沒多大改變，他還是像在瓊斯時代一樣，做事緩慢而固執，雖不偷懶但也不會自願多負責一些事情。他對於抗爭及其結果不予置評，如果動物問他，瓊斯走了是否覺得比較開心，他只會回答說：「驢子壽命很長，你們都沒看過死驢子吧。」而其他動物也只能接受這種隱晦的答案。

星期天不用工作，早餐比平常晚一小時，用餐後還有個每週都會進行的儀式。首先是升旗，雪球在農具房找到一塊瓊斯太太的綠色舊桌布，他拿來當作旗子，在上面畫上白色的蹄子和角，每週日早晨在農舍院內的旗杆上升起。雪球向大家解釋，綠色旗子代表英格蘭的綠色大地，蹄和角象徵推翻人類後所成立的動物共和國。升旗儀式過後，動物們一起進入穀倉集合，稱之為聚會，目的在於規劃未來一週的工作以及提出建議事項並進行辯論。提出意見的都是豬，其他動物雖然曉得怎麼投票，但想不出什麼建議。辯論過程中，雪球和拿破崙的表現最為活躍，不過，大家發現他們總是不認同對方，彼此意見相左。就算是已經決定好的事情，像是把果園後面那片小牧場留作年老動物安養天年的場地，這種提議大家都不會反對，但他們還是能針對各種動物的適當退休年齡展開激烈辯論。聚會總以〈英格蘭之獸〉作結，下午則讓大家休息。

【注：这里指镰刀锤子。】

豬將農具室獨立出來作為總部，還從農舍找來各類書籍，內容含括鍛冶、木工及其他必備技術，晚上就在這裡研讀。雪球更忙著為動物組織各種委員會，並且樂此不疲，除了安排閱讀及寫字課程，他為母雞成立雞蛋生產委員會，替牛創辦尾巴清潔聯盟，還專門為了馴化老鼠與野兔創設野生同志再教育委員會，此外也有綿羊專屬的白淨羊毛運動及其他更多各種不同的組織。但是，整體而言，這些規劃都不見成效。舉例來說，馴化野生動物這項行動幾乎是立即失敗。野生動物依然故我，還得了便宜就賣乖。貓也是再教育委員會的成員，有幾天表現很活躍，某天，其他動物看到她坐在屋頂，對著伸掌不及的麻雀說，所有動物現在都是同志，只要願意，任何麻雀都可以在她爪子上棲息，不過麻雀依然離得遠遠的。

閱讀及寫字課程倒是成效卓著，農莊內動物們幾乎都在入秋前多少認識了一些字。

豬早就善於閱讀寫字。狗閱讀學得很不錯，可是只對閱讀七誡感興趣。白羊穆里兒的閱讀能力比狗好一點，有時會從垃圾堆中找來破報紙，在晚上念給其他動物聽。班傑明的閱讀能力和豬一樣優秀，但從不善用這份能力，他說，就他所知，沒什麼值得一讀的東西。幸運草把所有字母學起來了，但是把字母拼成字卻是個難題。拳擊手只學到D，他會用大蹄子在地上寫出A、B、C、D，然後豎起耳朵站在原地盯著字母看，時而聳聳額毛，絞盡腦汁想記起接下來是哪個字母，但每次只是白費工夫。事實上，拳擊手有好幾次都把E、F、G、H學起來了，但是記住這四個字母卻忘掉A、B、C、D。最後，他決定對只會前四個字母感到滿足，還習慣每天練習寫一兩次來加強記憶。莫莉除了拼出自己名字的六個字母外，其他什麼都不想學，她常常拿樹枝工整地排出自己的名字，再摘一兩朵花來裝飾，接著繞著自己的名字不停讚美。

農莊其他動物頂多只能記住A，羊、母雞和鴨之類較為愚笨的動物連七誡都記不牢。雪球左思右想，宣布七誡一言以蔽之即「四足善，雙足惡」。他說，這包含了動物主義的精髓，只要完全參透就能免受人類影響。鳥兒們起初持反對意見，因為他們也算在雙足這邊，但雪球向他們證明事實並非如此。

「同志們，」他表示：「鳥的翅膀是飛行器官，而非操作事物的工具，所以應視為腳。人類最明顯的特徵是手，萬惡皆源自於此。」

鳥兒們雖然搞不懂雪球的長篇大論，但還是接受這番解釋，於是，動物們很認真地想將新格言默背起來。「四足善，雙足惡」也寫在穀倉牆上，位置就在七誡上方，字體也比較大。羊群記牢這句格言後愛不釋口，躺在田野上時經常一齊咩咩叫著「四足善，雙足惡」、「四足善，雙足惡」，一叫好幾個小時，從不厭倦。

拿破崙對於雪球組織的委員會興趣缺缺，比起為成年動物所做的一切，他認為教育年輕一代更為重要。收割完乾草沒多久，潔西和藍鈴正好產下九隻健壯的小狗，小狗一斷奶就被拿破崙帶走，說是要教育他們。他將狗兒安置在閣樓，那是一個得從農具房搭梯子才能上去的地方。小狗待在這麼隱密的空間，其他動物沒多久便忘了他們的存在。

牛奶消失之謎不久便真相大白，原來被摻進豬群每天的飼料裡。青澀蘋果現已成熟，被風吹落在果園草地上。動物們認為照例該均分這些蘋果，可是有天一道命令下來，要大家把被風吹落的蘋果都送到農具房供豬食用。有些動物感到不滿，卻也於事無補，因為所有豬隻皆無異議，就連雪球和拿破崙也是如此，他們還要尖叫者去向其他動物做些必要的解釋。

「同志們，」尖叫者喊道：「希望你們不要以為我們這些豬這麼做很自私，許多豬其實不喜歡牛奶和蘋果，我自己就是如此，我們只是想要靠這些食物保持健康。牛奶和蘋果（同志們，經由科學證明）含有健康豬隻不可或缺的重要養分。我們這些豬成天動腦，負責整座農莊的管理與組織，不分日夜捍衛各位的福利，所以，我們是為了你們才喝牛奶、吃蘋果的。如果我們沒辦法工作，你們知道會發生什麼事嗎？瓊斯會回來！沒錯，瓊斯會回來！同志們，事實就是如此。」尖叫者跳來蹦去、甩動尾巴，近乎懇求地吶喊著：「你們都不想讓瓊斯回來，對吧？」

現在，如果要說有什麼事情是動物們百分之百肯定的，那就是不希望瓊斯回來。這番言論讓他們無話可說，維持豬的健康很明顯是件重要大事。也因此大家不再爭論，同意將牛奶和被風吹落的蘋果（以及絕大部分熟成採下的蘋果）留給豬食用。

2　一蒲式耳在英國等於三十六點三六八公升，在美國等於三十五點二三八公升。



## Chapter 4


**BY THE LATE SUMMER the news of what had happened on Animal Farm had spread across half the county. Every day Snowball and Napoleon sent out flights of pigeons whose instructions were to mingle with the animals on neighbouring farms, tell them the story of the Rebellion, and teach them the tune of "Beasts of England."**

Most of this time Mr. Jones had spent sitting in the taproom of the Red Lion at Willingdon, complaining to anyone who would listen of the monstrous injustice he had suffered in being turned out of his property by a pack of good-for-nothing animals. The other farmers sympathised in principle, but they did not at first give him much help. At heart, each of them was secretly wondering whether he could not somehow turn Jones's misfortune to his own advantage. It was lucky that the owners of the two farms which adjoined Animal Farm were on permanently bad terms. One of them, which was named Foxwood, was a large, neglected, old-fashioned farm, much overgrown by woodland, with all its pastures worn out and its hedges in a disgraceful condition. Its owner, Mr. Pilkington, was an easy-going gentleman farmer who spent most of his time in fishing or hunting according to the season. The other farm, which was called Pinchfield, was smaller and better kept. Its owner was a Mr. Frederick, a tough, shrewd man, perpetually involved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hard bargains. These two disliked each other so much that it was difficult for them to come to any agreement, even in defence of their own interests.

**Nevertheless, they were both thoroughly frightened by the rebellion on Animal Farm, and very anxious to prevent their own animals from learning too much about it. At first they pretended to laugh to scorn the idea of animals managing a farm for themselves. The whole thing would be over in a fortnight, they said. They put it about that the animals on the Manor Farm (they insisted on calling it the Manor Farm; they would not tolerate the name "Animal Farm") were perpetually fighting among themselves and were also rapidly starving to death. When time passed and the animals had evidently not starved to death, Frederick and Pilkington changed their tune and began to talk of the terrible wickedness that now flourished on Animal Farm. It was given out that the animals there practised cannibalism, tortured one another with red-hot horseshoes, and had their females in common. This was what came of rebelling against the laws of Nature, Frederick and Pilkington said**.

However, these stories were never fully believed. Rumours of a wonderful farm, where the human beings had been turned out and the animals managed their own affairs, continued to circulate in vague and distorted forms, and throughout that year a wave of rebelliousness ran through the countryside. Bulls which had always been tractable suddenly turned savage, sheep broke down hedges and devoured the clover, cows kicked the pail over, hunters refused their fences and shot their riders on to the other side. Above all, the tune and even the words of "Beasts of England" were known everywhere. It had spread with astonishing speed. The human beings could not contain their rage when they heard this song, though they pretended to think it merely ridiculous. They could not understand, they said, how even animals could bring themselves to sing such contemptible rubbish. Any animal caught singing it was given a flogging on the spot. And yet the song was irrepressible. The blackbirds whistled it in the hedges, the pigeons cooed it in the elms, it got into the din of the smithies and the tune of the church bells. And when the human beings listened to it, they secretly trembled, hearing in it a prophecy of their future doom.

Early in October, when the corn was cut and stacked and some of it was already threshed, a flight of pigeons came whirling through the air and alighted in the yard of Animal Farm in the wildest excitement. Jones and all his men, with half a dozen others from Foxwood and Pinchfield, had entered the five-barred gate and were coming up the cart-track that led to the farm. They were all carrying sticks, except Jones, who was marching ahead with a gun in his hands. Obviously they were going to attempt the recapture of the farm.

This had long been expected, and all preparations had been made. Snowball, who had studied an old book of Julius Caesar's campaigns which he had found in the farmhouse, was in charge of the defensive operations. He gave his orders quickly, and in a couple of minutes every animal was at his post.

**As the human beings approached the farm buildings, Snowball launched his first attack. All the pigeons, to the number of thirty-five, flew to and fro over the men's heads and muted upon them from mid-air; and while the men were dealing with this, the geese, who had been hiding behind the hedge, rushed out and pecked viciously at the calves of their legs. However, this was only a light skirmishing manoeuvre, intended to create a little disorder, and the men easily drove the geese off with their sticks. Snowball now launched his second line of attack. Muriel, Benjamin, and all the sheep, with Snowball at the head of them, rushed forward and prodded and butted the men from every side, while Benjamin turned round and lashed at them with his small hoofs. But once again the men, with their sticks and their hob-nailed boots, were too strong for them; and suddenly, at a squeal from Snowball, which was the signal for retreat, all the animals turned and fled through the gateway into the yard.**

The men gave a shout of triumph. They saw, as they imagined, their enemies in flight, and they rushed after them in disorder. This was just what Snowball had intended. As soon as they were well inside the yard, the three horses, the three cows, and the rest of the pigs, who had been lying in ambush in the cowshed, suddenly emerged in their rear, cutting them off. Snowball now gave the signal for the charge. He himself dashed straight for Jones. Jones saw him coming, raised his gun and fired. The pellets scored bloody streaks along Snowball's back, and a sheep dropped dead. Without halting for an instant, Snowball flung his fifteen stone against Jones's legs. Jones was hurled into a pile of dung and his gun flew out of his hands. But the most terrifying spectacle of all was Boxer, rearing up on his hind legs and striking out with his great iron-shod hoofs like a stallion. His very first blow took a stable-lad from Foxwood on the skull and stretched him lifeless in the mud. At the sight, several men dropped their sticks and tried to run. Panic overtook them, and the next moment all the animals together were chasing them round and round the yard. They were gored, kicked, bitten, trampled on. There was not an animal on the farm that did not take vengeance on them after his own fashion. Even the cat suddenly leapt off a roof onto a cowman's shoulders and sank her claws in his neck, at which he yelled horribly. At a moment when the opening was clear, the men were glad enough to rush out of the yard and make a bolt for the main road. And so within five minutes of their invasion they were in ignominious retreat by the same way as they had come, with a flock of geese hissing after them and pecking at their calves all the way.

All the men were gone except one. Back in the yard Boxer was pawing with his hoof at the stable-lad who lay face down in the mud, trying to turn him over. The boy did not stir.

"He is dead," said Boxer sorrowfully. "I had no intention of doing that. I forgot that I was wearing iron shoes. Who will believe that I did not do this on purpose?"

**"No sentimentality, comrade!" cried Snowball, from whose wounds the blood was still dripping. "War is war. The only good human being is a dead one."**

"I have no wish to take life, not even human life," repeated Boxer, and his eyes were full of tears.

"Where is Mollie?" exclaimed somebody.

Mollie in fact was missing. For a moment there was great alarm; it was feared that the men might have harmed her in some way, or even carried her off with them. In the end, however, she was found hiding in her stall with her head buried among the hay in the manger. She had taken to flight as soon as the gun went off. And when the others came back from looking for her, it was to find that the stable-lad, who in fact was only stunned, had already recovered and made off.

The animals had now reassembled in the wildest excitement, each recounting his own exploits in the battle at the top of his voice. An impromptu celebration of the victory was held immediately. The flag was run up and "Beasts of England" was sung a number of times, then the sheep who had been killed was given a solemn funeral, a hawthorn bush being planted on her grave. At the graveside Snowball made a little speech, emphasising the need for all animals to be ready to die for Animal Farm if need be.

The animals decided unanimously to create a military decoration, "Animal Hero, First Class," which was conferred there and then on Snowball and Boxer. It consisted of a brass medal (they were really some old horse-brasses which had been found in the harness-room), to be worn on Sundays and holidays. There was also "Animal Hero, Second Class," which was conferred posthumously on the dead sheep.

There was much discussion as to what the battle should be called. In the end, it was named the Battle of the Cowshed, since that was where the ambush had been sprung. Mr. Jones's gun had been found lying in the mud, and it was known that there was a supply of cartridges in the farmhouse. It was decided to set the gun up at the foot of the flagstaff, like a piece of artillery, and to fire it twice a year—once on October the twelfth, the anniversary of the Battle of the Cowshed, and once on Midsummer Day, the anniversary of the Rebellion.


## 第 4 章

夏天接近尾聲時，動物農莊所發生的事情已經傳遍半個威靈頓。雪球和拿破崙每天派鴿子到鄰近農莊去和那裡的動物往來，藉機宣傳抗爭事蹟並教他們唱〈英格蘭之獸〉。

這些日子裡，瓊斯先生大多待在威靈頓的紅獅酒吧，逢人便抱怨受到極為不公平的對待，竟然被一群沒用的動物趕出自己的農莊。基本上，其他農夫對瓊斯頗為同情，但起先並未提供太多幫助，只顧暗自算計能從瓊斯的不幸中撈到什麼好處。幸運的是，動物農莊附近有兩名農莊主人一直不對盤。其中一座農莊叫狐林，是座占地廣大但疏於照料的舊式農莊，莊內雜木叢生、牧場荒蕪且籬笆年久失修。擁有者皮金頓先生是個隨和、有禮貌的農夫，大部分時間不是釣魚就是打獵，依季節而定。另一座農莊名叫狹地，規模較小但管理得較好。擁有者腓特烈先生強勢又精明，永遠有打不完的官司，還是討價還價的高手。這兩人厭惡彼此、從不妥協，就算要他們捍衛共同利益也是難事一樁。

然而，動物農莊的抗爭行動卻讓他倆嚇壞了，很希望這件事情不要傳到自己養的牲畜耳裡。起先，他們裝模作樣地嘲笑動物自主的想法，還說這起事件半個月內就會終結，更宣稱曼諾農莊（他們無法忍受「動物農莊」一詞，所以堅持使用「曼諾農莊」）的動物彼此不斷鬥爭，即將餓死。不過，隨著時間流逝，動物們顯然沒有餓死。於是腓特烈和皮金頓改變論調，大談目前動物農莊內的醜惡行徑。他們說裡面的動物吃同類、用炙熱的馬蹄鐵互相虐待還共享雌性動物，根本違背自然法則。

其他動物對這種說法半信半疑，耳語流傳的是，有座迷人的農莊，沒有人類只有動物管理生活大小事。如此消息四處散播，愈傳愈虛妄不實，也使得英格蘭在那一整年裡興起陣陣抗爭浪潮。一向溫馴的公牛突然變得粗暴野蠻，羊群踏壞籬笆、吃光苜蓿，乳牛踢開奶桶，獵馬不願參與圍獵，反而把騎在身上的主人甩到一邊。更誇張的是，〈英格蘭之獸〉的旋律甚至歌詞傳遍各地，速度之快令人咋舌。人類每次聽到便怒不可遏，但表面上還是說這首歌很可笑，搞不懂為什麼動物會唱這種垃圾爛歌。只要他們聽到哪隻動物在唱，馬上就是一頓抽打，但依舊止不住此起彼落的歌聲。畫眉於籬笆間啁啾囀唱，鴿子在榆樹上咕咕鳴叫，他們的歌聲與鐵匠舖的鏗鏘聲和教堂鐘聲融為一體，人們聽到便默默驚怕，好似聽見末日預言。

十月初，穀物都已收割貯藏好，有些還去了殼。一天，一群鴿子在空中盤旋，十分激動地飛進動物農莊院子裡。他們說，瓊斯及其手下帶領另外六名來自狐林農莊和狹地農莊的人馬通過柵門，踏上通往動物農莊的車道。他們人手一棍，帶頭的瓊斯握著槍，目的顯然是要奪回農莊。

動物們早就料到這一切，已做好萬全準備。雪球在農舍找到一本舊書，內容描述尤利烏斯·凱撒的戰績，他仔細研讀從而負責防禦工作。雪球迅速下達指令，過沒幾分鐘，動物們便各就各位。

人類逼近倉舍之際，雪球發動第一波攻勢，三十五隻鴿子同時出動，在人類頭頂上來回盤旋，同時從半空中排下糞便。正當人類忙著應付鴿子時，躲在籬笆後面的鵝衝了出來，朝人類小腿猛啄。不過，這只算是小規模作戰，目的在於製造混亂，人類靠著棍子便輕易趕走鵝群。雪球緊接著發動第二波攻勢，穆里兒、班傑明以及所有羊隻在他帶領下衝上前去，從四面八方對人類又撞又刺，班傑明轉過身以細瘦的後腳進行踹擊。但是人類的棍子和釘靴太過強勢，雪球尖嘯一聲，示意大家撤退，動物們轉身逃往院子。

人類勝利歡呼，以為敵人已作鳥獸散，於是零零落落地在後頭追趕，這正合雪球心意。人類一進院子，原本在牛棚埋伏的三匹馬、三頭牛及其他豬隻全衝出來包抄。雪球再度示意攻擊，自己則一頭衝向瓊斯，瓊斯見他迎面而來，舉槍扣下扳機，子彈散粒在雪球背上造成數道血痕，更讓一頭羊當場死亡。雪球近百公斤的身軀當下便往瓊斯雙腿衝去，將他撞飛到糞堆上，槍也因而離手。然而，最駭人的場面當屬拳擊手的攻擊行動，他如種馬般抬起前腿，巨大鐵蹄在半空中猛力一踹，一擊正中狐林農莊馬夫的腦袋，讓他倒地身亡。看到這一幕，有些人嚇破了膽，丟下棍子想逃，卻被追著滿院跑。他們被頂、被踹、被咬又被踩，每隻動物莫不依自己的方式報仇，就連貓也突然從屋頂跳到牧牛人肩上，利爪刮向他的脖子，牧牛人不禁痛得大叫。後來，通道空了一陣子，人類喜不自勝，趁機衝出院子，往大馬路奔去。最終，為時五分鐘的入侵行動換來落荒而逃，就跟來的時候一樣，鵝群在後頭追趕，一路猛啄他們的小腿。

所有人類都逃走了，只剩一人留在現場，拳擊手回到院子裡，舉起蹄子撥弄面朝泥濘、倒地不起的馬夫，試圖將他翻過身來，但馬夫一動也不動。

「他死了，」拳擊手傷心地說：「我不是故意的，我忘記自己戴了蹄鐵，誰相信我不是有心的呢？」

「同志，別再感傷了！」雪球身上的傷口流著鮮血，喊道：「戰爭就是戰爭，只有死人才是好人。」

「我並沒打算開殺戒，就算是人類我也不想置之於死地。」拳擊手眼含淚水，不斷重複這句話。

「莫莉在哪裡？」有隻動物驚叫出聲。

莫莉失蹤了，動物們一陣恐慌，擔心有人對她不利，或者直接將她擄走。然而，大家最後在莫莉的馬廄裡找到她，她躲在裡頭，頭埋在馬槽乾草中，原來莫莉在槍響時便倉皇逃走。動物們後來也發現，院子裡的馬夫只是嚇暈，醒來後已經趁大家尋找莫莉時溜走。

欣喜若狂的動物們再次集合，大聲細數自己在戰鬥過程中的英勇表現，一場即興的勝利慶祝會立即展開。他們升起旗幟，高唱〈英格蘭之獸〉數次，接著為慘遭殺害的那隻羊舉辦隆重的葬禮，更在他墳上種下山楂樹。雪球在墓旁發表了一段簡短的演說，強調所有動物必要時都該為動物農莊犧牲。

動物們無異議決定建立軍事勳章制度，當下就授與雪球及拳擊手「動物英雄一等勳章」。那是枚黃銅製的勳章（其實就是農具房內找到的舊黃銅馬飾），可在星期天及假日時佩帶。此外，還有「動物英雄二等勳章」，頒給死去的羊。

動物們熱烈討論該如何稱呼這場戰爭，最後決定命名為牛棚之戰，因為突擊就是在牛棚發動的。他們在泥濘之中找到瓊斯先生的槍，再加上農舍內還留有彈匣，於是決定將槍立在旗杆底下，每年發射兩次，一次在十月十二日，也就是牛棚之戰週年紀念日，另一次則於仲夏日，即抗爭週年紀念日。


## Chapter 5


AS WINTER DREW ON, Mollie became more and more troublesome. She was late for work every morning and excused herself by saying she had overslept, and she complained of mysterious pains, although her appetite was excellent. On every kind of pretext she would run away from work and go to the drinking pool, where she would stand foolishly gazing at her own reflection in the water. But there were also rumours of something more serious. One day as Mollie strolled blithely into the yard, flirting her long tail and chewing at a stalk of hay, Clover took her aside.

"Mollie," she said, "I have something very serious to say to you. This morning I saw you looking over the hedge that divides Animal Farm from Foxwood. One of Mr. Pilkington's men was standing on the other side of the hedge. And—I was a long way away, but I am almost certain I saw this—he was talking to you and you were allowing him to stroke your nose. What does that mean, Mollie?"

"He didn't! I wasn't! It isn't true!" cried Mollie, beginning to prance about and paw the ground.

"Mollie! Look me in the face. Do you give me your word of honour that that man was not stroking your nose?"

"It isn't true!" repeated Mollie, but she could not look Clover in the face, and the next moment she took to her heels and galloped away into the field.

A thought struck Clover. Without saying anything to the others, she went to Mollie's stall and turned over the straw with her hoof. Hidden under the straw was a little pile of lump sugar and several bunches of ribbon of different colours.

**Three days later Mollie disappeared. For some weeks nothing was known of her whereabouts, then the pigeons reported that they had seen her on the other side of Willingdon. She was between the shafts of a smart dogcart painted red and black, which was standing outside a public-house. A fat red-faced man in check breeches and gaiters, who looked like a publican, was stroking her nose and feeding her with sugar. Her coat was newly clipped and she wore a scarlet ribbon round her forelock. She appeared to be enjoying herself, so the pigeons said. None of the animals ever mentioned Mollie again.**

In January there came bitterly hard weather. The earth was like iron, and nothing could be done in the fields. Many meetings were held in the big barn, and the pigs occupied themselves with planning out the work of the coming season. It had come to be accepted that the pigs, who were manifesdy cleverer than the other animals, should decide all questions of farm policy, though their decisions had to be ratified by a majority vote. This arrangement would have worked well enough if it had not been for the disputes between Snowball and Napoleon. These two disagreed at every point where disagreement was possible. If one of them suggested sowing a bigger acreage with barley, the other was certain to demand a bigger acreage of oats, and if one of them said that such and such a field was just right for cabbages, the other would declare that it was useless for anything except roots. Each had his own following, and there were some violent debates. At the Meetings Snowball often won over the majority by his brilliant speeches, but Napoleon was better at canvassing support for himself in between times. He was especially successful with the sheep. Of late the sheep had taken to bleating "Four legs good, two legs bad" both in and out of season, and they often interrupted the Meeting with this. It was noticed that they were especially liable to break into "Four legs good, two legs bad" at crucial moments in Snowball's speeches. Snowball had made a close study of some back numbers of the Farmer and Stockbreeder which he had found in the farmhouse, and was full of plans for innovations and improvements. He talked learnedly about field-drains, silage, and basic slag, and had worked out a complicated scheme for all the animals to drop their dung directly in the fields, at a different spot every day, to save the labour of cartage. Napoleon produced no schemes of his own, but said quietly that Snowball's would come to nothing, and seemed to be biding his time. But of all their controversies, none was so bitter as the one that took place over the windmill.

In the long pasture, not far from the farm buildings, there was a small knoll which was the highest point on the farm. After surveying the ground, Snowball declared that this was just the place for a windmill, which could be made to operate a dynamo and supply the farm with electrical power. This would light the stalls and warm them in winter, and would also run a circular saw, a chaff-cutter, a mangel-slicer, and an electric milking machine. The animals had never heard of anything of this kind before (for the farm was an old-fashioned one and had only the most primitive machinery), and they listened in astonishment while Snowball conjured up pictures of fantastic machines which would do their work for them while they grazed at their ease in the fields or improved their minds with reading and conversation.

Within a few weeks Snowball's plans for the windmill were fully worked out. The mechanical details came mostly from three books which had belonged to Mr. Jones—_One Thousand Useful Things to Do About the House_, _Every Man His Own Bricklayer_, and _Electricity for Beginners_. Snowball used as his study a shed which had once been used for incubators and had a smooth wooden floor, suitable for drawing on. He was closeted there for hours at a time. With his books held open by a stone, and with a piece of chalk gripped between the knuckles of his trotter, he would move rapidly to and fro, drawing in line after line and uttering little whimpers of excitement. Gradually the plans grew into a complicated mass of cranks and cog-wheels, covering more than half the floor, which the other animals found completely unintelligible but very impressive. All of them came to look at Snowball's drawings at least once a day. Even the hens and ducks came, and were at pains not to tread on the chalk marks. Only Napoleon held aloof. He had declared himself against the windmill from the start. One day, however, he arrived unexpectedly to examine the plans. He walked heavily round the shed, looked closely at every detail of the plans and snuffed at them once or twice, then stood for a little while contemplating them out of the corner of his eye; then suddenly he lifted his leg, urinated over the plans, and walked out without uttering a word.

The whole farm was deeply divided on the subject of the windmill. Snowball did not deny that to build it would be a difficult business. Stone would have to be carried and built up into walls, then the sails would have to be made and after that there would be need for dynamos and cables. (How these were to be procured, Snowball did not say.) But he maintained that it could all be done in a year. And thereafter, he declared, so much labour would be saved that the animals would only need to work three days a week. Napoleon, on the other hand, argued that the great need of the moment was to increase food production, and that if they wasted time on the windmill they would all starve to death. The animals formed themselves into two factions under the slogans, "Vote for Snowball and the three-day week" and "Vote for Napoleon and the full manger." Benjamin was the only animal who did not side with either faction. He refused to believe either that food would become more plentiful or that the windmill would save work. Windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on as it had always gone on—that is, badly.

Apart from the disputes over the windmill, there was the question of the defense of the farm. It was fully realised that though the human beings had been defeated in the Battle of the Cowshed they might make another and more determined attempt to recapture the farm and reinstate Mr. Jones. They had all the more reason for doing so because the news of their defeat had spread across the countryside and made the animals on the neighbouring farms more restive than ever. **As usual, Snowball and Napoleon were in disagreement. According to Napoleon, what the animals must do was to procure firearms and train themselves in the use of them. According to Snowball, they must send out more and more pigeons and stir up rebellion among the animals on the other farms. The one argued that if they could not defend themselves they were bound to be conquered, the other argued that if rebellions happened everywhere they would have no need to defend themselves. The animals listened first to Napoleon, then to Snowball, and could not make up their minds which was right; indeed, they always found themselves in agreement with the one who was speaking at the moment.**

At last the day came when Snowball's plans were completed. At the Meeting on the following Sunday the question of whether or not to begin work on the windmill was to be put to the vote. When the animals had assembled in the big barn, Snowball stood up and, though occasionally interrupted by bleating from the sheep, set forth his reasons for advocating the building of the windmill. Then Napoleon stood up to reply. He said very quietly that the windmill was nonsense and that he advised nobody to vote for it, and promptly sat down again; he had spoken for barely thirty seconds, and seemed almost indifferent as to the effect he produced. At this Snowball sprang to his feet, and shouting down the sheep, who had begun bleating again, broke into a passionate appeal in favour of the windmill. Until now the animals had been about equally divided in their sympathies, but in a moment Snowball's eloquence had carried them away. In glowing sentences he painted a picture of Animal Farm as it might be when sordid labour was lifted from the animals' backs. His imagination had now run far beyond chaff-cutters and turnip-slicers. Electricity, he said, could operate threshing machines, ploughs, harrows, rollers, and reapers and binders, besides supplying every stall with its own electric light, hot and cold water, and an electric heater. By the time he had finished speaking, there was no doubt as to which way the vote would go. But just at this moment Napoleon stood up and, casting a peculiar sidelong look at Snowball, uttered a high-pitched whimper of a kind no one had ever heard him utter before.

At this there was a terrible baying sound outside, and nine enormous dogs wearing brass-studded collars came bounding into the barn. They dashed straight for Snowball, who only sprang from his place just in time to escape their snapping jaws. In a moment he was out of the door and they were after him. Too amazed and frightened to speak, all the animals crowded through the door to watch the chase. Snowball was racing across the long pasture that led to the road. He was running as only a pig can run, but the dogs were close on his heels. Suddenly he slipped and it seemed certain that they had him. Then he was up again, running faster than ever, then the dogs were gaining on him again. One of them all but closed his jaws on Snowball's tail, but Snowball whisked it free just in time. Then he put on an extra spurt and, with a few inches to spare, slipped through a hole in the hedge and was seen no more.

Silent and terrified, the animals crept back into the barn. In a moment the dogs came bounding back. At first no one had been able to imagine where these creatures came from, but the problem was soon solved: they were the puppies whom Napoleon had taken away from their mothers and reared privately. Though not yet full-grown, they were huge dogs, and as fierce-looking as wolves. They kept close to Napoleon. It was noticed that they wagged their tails to him in the same way as the other dogs had been used to do to Mr. Jones.

Napoleon, with the dogs following him, now mounted on to the raised portion of the floor where Major had previously stood to deliver his speech. He announced that from now on the Sunday-morning Meetings would come to an end. They were unnecessary, he said, and wasted time. In future all questions relating to the working of the farm would be settled by a special committee of pigs, presided over by himself. These would meet in private and afterwards communicate their decisions to the others. The animals would still assemble on Sunday mornings to salute the flag, sing "Beasts of England," and receive their orders for the week; but there would be no more debates.

In spite of the shock that Snowball's expulsion had given them, the animals were dismayed by this announcement. Several of them would have protested if they could have found the right arguments. Even Boxer was vaguely troubled. He set his ears back, shook his forelock several times, and tried hard to marshal his thoughts; but in the end he could not think of anything to say. Some of the pigs themselves, however, were more articulate. Four young porkers in the front row uttered shrill squeals of disapproval, and all four of them sprang to their feet and began speaking at once. But suddenly the dogs sitting round Napoleon let out deep, menacing growls, and the pigs fell silent and sat down again. Then the sheep broke out into a tremendous bleating of "Four legs good, two legs bad!" which went on for nearly a quarter of an hour and put an end to any chance of discussion.

Afterwards Squealer was sent round the farm to explain the new arrangement to the others.

"Comrades," he said, "I trust that every animal here appreciates the sacrifice that Comrade Napoleon has made in taking this extra labour upon himself. Do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is a pleasure! On the contrary, it is a deep and heavy responsibility. No one believes more firmly than Comrade Napoleon that all animals are equal. He would be only too happy to let you make your decisions for yourselves. But sometimes you might make the wrong decisions, comrades, and then where should we be? Suppose you had decided to follow Snowball, with his moonshine of windmills—Snowball, who, as we now know, was no better than a criminal?"

"He fought bravely at the Battle of the Cowshed," said somebody.

"Bravery is not enough," said Squealer. "Loyalty and obedience are more important. And as to the Battle of the Cowshed, I believe the time will come when we shall find that Snowball's part in it was much exaggerated. Discipline, comrades, iron discipline! That is the watchword for today. One false step, and our enemies would be upon us. Surely, comrades, you do not want Jones back?"

Once again this argument was unanswerable. Certainly the animals did not want Jones back; if the holding of debates on Sunday mornings was liable to bring him back, then the debates must stop. Boxer, who had now had time to think things over, voiced the general feeling by saying: "If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right." And from then on he adopted the maxim, "Napoleon is always right," in addition to his private motto of "I will work harder."

By this time the weather had broken and the spring ploughing had begun. The shed where Snowball had drawn his plans of the windmill had been shut up and it was assumed that the plans had been rubbed off the floor. Every Sunday morning at ten o'clock the animals assembled in the big barn to receive their orders for the week. The skull of old Major, now clean of flesh, had been disinterred from the orchard and set up on a stump at the foot of the flagstaff, beside the gun. After the hoisting of the flag, the animals were required to file past the skull in a reverent manner before entering the barn. Nowadays they did not sit all together as they had done in the past. Napoleon, with Squealer and another pig named Minimus, who had a remarkable gift for composing songs and poems, sat on the front of the raised platform, with the nine young dogs forming a semicircle round them, and the other pigs sitting behind. The rest of the animals sat facing them in the main body of the barn. Napoleon read out the orders for the week in a gruff soldierly style, and after a single singing of "Beasts of England," all the animals dispersed.

**On the third Sunday after Snowball's expulsion, the animals were somewhat surprised to hear Napoleon announce that the windmill was to be built after all. He did not give any reason for having changed his mind, but merely warned the animals that this extra task would mean very hard work; it might even be necessary to reduce their rations. The plans, however, had all been prepared, down to the last detail. A special committee of pigs had been at work upon them for the past three weeks. The building of the windmill, with various other improvements, was expected to take two years.**

**That evening Squealer explained privately to the other animals that Napoleon had never in reality been opposed to the windmill. On the contrary, it was he who had advocated it in the beginning, and the plan which Snowball had drawn on the floor of the incubator shed had actually been stolen from among Napoleon's papers. The windmill was, in fact, Napoleon's own creation. Why, then, asked somebody, had he spoken so strongly against it? Here Squealer looked very sly. That, he said, was Comrade Napoleon's cunning. He had seemed to oppose the windmill, simply as a manoeuvre to get rid of Snowball, who was a dangerous character and a bad influence. Now that Snowball was out of the way, the plan could go forward without his interference. This, said Squealer, was something called tactics. He repeated a number of times, "Tactics, comrades, tactics!" skipping round and whisking his tail with a merry laugh. The animals were not certain what the word meant, but Squealer spoke so persuasively, and the three dogs who happened to be with him growled so threateningly, that they accepted his explanation without further questions.**

## 第 5 章

冬天腳步愈來愈近，莫莉也愈來愈讓人傷腦筋。她每天早上工作都會遲到，老是拿睡過頭當藉口，常常抱怨身體沒來由地疼痛，胃口卻出奇地好。莫莉會以各種推託之詞逃避工作，跑到水池邊傻傻地凝視自己的倒影。但是，聽說還有更嚴重的事情。有一天，莫莉快活地溜達進院子裡，邊走邊搖著長長的尾巴，嘴裡還嚼著根乾草，這時幸運草把她拉到一旁說話。

「莫莉，」她說：「我要跟你談件很重要的事情。今天早上，我看到你探頭望動物農莊和狐林農莊之間的籬笆。皮金頓的手下就站在籬笆另一邊，雖然我離你們有一大段距離，但是我的確見到他對你講話，你還讓他摸你的鼻子。莫莉，這是怎麼回事？」

「他才沒那麼做！我也沒讓他那樣！那不是真的！」莫莉大聲叫道，接著來回踱步還伸出前蹄刨著地。

「莫莉，看著我！你願意用名譽保證，那個人沒有摸你鼻子嗎？」

「那不是真的！」莫莉如此重複道，卻不敢直視幸運草，然後拔腿就往田地裡跑。

幸運草腦中閃過一個念頭，她並未向其他動物提起這件事，逕自前往莫莉的廄棚，以蹄子挑開稻草，結果在底下找到一些糖塊和好幾條不同顏色的緞帶。

三天後，莫莉不見了，有好幾個星期下落不明。之後才從鴿子的報告中得知她身處威靈頓另一邊，在一家酒館前幫人拉車。她拉的車外形精巧，顏色以紅、黑為主。有個男人臉紅體胖，身穿方格子馬褲及綁腿，看起來像是酒館老闆，他摸著莫莉的鼻子並餵她糖吃。鴿子還說，莫莉神色自得地穿著全新剪裁的衣服，額毛上繫著一條紅緞帶。從此，動物們絕口不提莫莉。

到了一月，天氣十分惡劣，大地凍得像鐵一樣硬，田裡沒活可幹，因此大穀倉裡舉行了多次聚會，豬隻們全神規劃下一季的工作。所有動物都接受讓明顯比其他動物聰明的豬決定農務方針，不過，他們下的決定依舊得通過多數決。這樣的模式本來很不錯，但雪球和拿破崙卻造成問題。他們彼此意見不合，一見著機會就表態反對，如果其中一方建議多種一畝大麥，另一方一定會要求多種燕麥；如果其中一個說某塊田地適合種包心菜，另一個就非要說根莖類作物才是唯一選擇。他們各有支持者，雙方發生過幾次激烈辯論。在聚會中，雪球常靠出色演說取得多數動物認同，拿破崙則擅長於休息時拉票，他這招對羊群特別有效。近來，羊群迷上咩叫「四足善，雙足惡」，他們嘴裡無時不在嘟囔這句話，常因此害聚會中斷。大家還注意到，他們最常在雪球的演講進入高潮時突然大喊「四足善，雙足惡」。雪球在農舍找到幾本過期的《農人與畜牧者》雜誌，仔細研讀後，胸中滿是革新與改進計畫。他談起農地排水、飼料保鮮及鹼性爐渣等頭頭是道，還研擬出一套複雜的制度，要動物們每天直接在田裡不同地點排泄，以精簡運送所需勞力。拿破崙沒規劃過任何方案，總平靜地說雪球的方案終將失敗，而且看起來就是在等這一刻到來。這兩隻豬爭執良多，最嚴重的一次當屬風車建造計畫。

倉舍不遠處有塊狹長的牧場，那裡有座小山丘，是農莊內的最高點。經過一番地形考察，雪球宣布要在這裡建造風車，以此運作發電機，為農莊提供電力，一來用作廄棚照明，二來以備冬天時取暖，還能發動圓鋸、鍘草機、甜菜切片機與電動擠奶機。動物們以前從沒聽過這些東西（因為這是座舊式農莊，只有較為簡單的機器），大家目瞪口呆地聽著雪球講述這些神奇的機器將如何提供協助，讓他們能輕鬆地在田裡吃草，或者透過閱讀、聊天提升心智。

沒幾個星期，雪球便將風車建造圖完全設計好，細部構造主要參考瓊斯先生的三本書—《一千種蓋房子的有用技巧》、《人人都能當磚瓦工》及《電力學入門》。他把以前作為孵蛋室的棚子當書房，棚內平滑的木質地板很適合繪圖。雪球在裡面往往一待好幾個小時，他拿石頭壓著翻開的書，前蹄夾著一根粉筆，在裡面來回快速移動，隨著建造圖一橫一豎地被勾勒出來，時而發出細微的驚喜歎叫。建造圖慢慢出現許多複雜的曲軸和齒輪，畫滿了半片地板，其他動物雖然完全看不懂，但仍感到欽佩。動物們一天至少會來觀看雪球作圖一次，連母雞和鴨子都來，他們很小心地不去踩到粉筆痕跡。只有拿破崙對此漠不關心，他從一開始就表明自己對於風車建造計畫的反對立場。然而，有一天，他卻出乎意料地現身查看建造圖。拿破崙腳步沉重地在棚內走動，端詳每處細節，嗅了嗅建造圖一兩次，還站起來一會兒，斜眼盯著圖看。突然間，他抬起後腿，對圖撒了一泡尿，然後一語不發地離開。

農莊動物在風車計畫上歧見甚深，雪球不否認建造風車是棘手工程。大家要搬運石頭來蓋牆，還得製作風車翼，之後更需要發電機和纜線（雪球並未說明這些東西要從何取得）。但他強調這些事情可在一年內全部完成，並表示竣工之後將能省下許多勞力，大家每週只需工作三天。持反對意見的拿破崙則認為，當下最需要做的是增加食物產量，如果浪費時間在建造風車上，大家最後都會餓死。動物們分成兩派，各自鼓吹「票投雪球，週休四日」以及「票給拿破崙，食物永豐足」。班傑明是唯一沒有選邊站的動物，他既不相信食物會豐足也不認為風車能節省勞力。他說，不管有沒有風車，生活還是一如往常，也就是同樣糟糕。

除了風車所帶來的爭端，農莊的防禦工事也是項議題。雖然人類在牛棚之戰吃敗仗，動物們都很清楚他們會捲土重來，甚至將展現更強烈的決心要奪回農莊、讓瓊斯先生再度掌權。人類這次敗績傳遍英格蘭各地，鄰近農莊的動物加倍難以駕馭，因此更有理由要討回顏面。不過，雪球與拿破崙依舊意見相左。拿破崙的見解是，動物們現在要做的是設法取得槍枝並學會用法。但雪球認為他們必須派出更多鴿子，煽動其他農莊的動物起而抗爭。拿破崙辯說，如果沒有自衛能力，那麼終將被打敗。雪球則強調，如果抗爭四起，自我防衛便不再需要。動物們聽完拿破崙的意見接著又聽雪球的觀點，無法決定誰說的對。事實上，他們發現，誰開口說話他們就買誰的帳。

這一天終於到來，雪球完成了建造圖，接下來的週日聚會將表決是否要造風車。當所有動物都到大穀倉集合後，雪球站起身，儘管偶爾受到綿羊咩叫聲干擾，仍向大家闡述造風車的理由。之後，拿破崙起而回應，他非常平靜地說，造風車十分無意義，要大家不要投它，說完旋即坐下。他開口僅三十秒，有說跟沒說差不多。此時，雪球一躍而起，對底下再度發出咩叫聲的羊群大喊，要他們安靜，並激昂地呼籲大家支持造風車。在此之前，動物們並未明顯贊同哪一方，但能言善道的雪球打動他們的心。他口若懸河地勾勒出動物農莊新未來，屆時動物們不再艱苦辛勞。他的夢想藍圖不只局限在鍘草機和蕪菁切片機，他表示電力將帶動打穀機、耕耘機、碎土機、滾筒式碾米機、收割機還有捆把機。此外，每座廄棚也將有獨立電燈、冷熱水以及暖氣機。雪球一閉口，便不難想見票會投給誰了。就在這個時候，拿破崙站了起來，以一種奇特的眼神睨視雪球，發出一聲尖叫，那種叫法其他動物從未聽過。

穀倉外傳來恐怖的吠叫，九頭配戴黃銅項圈的大狗跳進穀倉，筆直衝向雪球。雪球及時跳離座位，躲過大狗利齒，接著逃出門外，狗群則在後頭追趕。所有動物驚怕得說不出話來，他們蜂擁而出，觀看這場追逐行動。雪球使盡吃奶的力氣往前跑，快速穿越狹長牧場，往大馬路上逃，而狗已經快追上他了。突然間，雪球滑了一跤，原本是會被狗抓住的，但是他再度爬起來，以生平最快的速度狂奔，接著狗又逐漸縮短距離，其中有隻狗幾乎快咬到他的尾巴了，雪球及時甩開，加速衝刺。就在只差一小段距離便可逃出狗掌時，雪球卻摔進籬笆中的洞裡，失去了蹤影。

動物們嚇得張口結舌、魂不附體，偷偷溜回穀倉。沒多久，九頭狗再度跳進穀倉。一開始，大家都猜不到這些狗打哪來的，但問題馬上有了答案。他們是拿破崙當初從狗媽媽身邊帶走、私下調教的小狗，雖然還沒完全長成成犬，身形已然十分碩大，外表凶狠如狼。大家注意到，這些狗站在拿破崙身邊搖著尾巴，和其他狗對待瓊斯先生的方式如出一轍。

拿破崙在狗群簇擁下，走上老少校當初發表演說的高台，宣布從此取消週日朝會，因為那沒必要且浪費時間。今後，所有農莊事務相關課題都將由豬群所組成的專責委員會處理。由他擔任委員會主席，豬隻委員私下開會，事後再將決議公告周知。不過，動物們週日早晨仍要舉行升旗典禮，唱〈英格蘭之獸〉，接受未來一週之工作分派，但不再進行任何辯論。

雪球遭到驅離令動物們大驚失色，這項公告更教他們沮喪不已。如果找得到適當的論點，很多動物都想抗議。就連拳擊手都覺得有點不快，他雙耳緊貼頭部，數度聳動額毛，很認真地想釐清思路，但終究無法發表任何意見。有些豬比較善於表達，像四頭坐在前排的年輕肉豬就發出刺耳的尖叫表達不滿，甚至站起來準備開口說話。但拿破崙身旁的狗立刻發出低吼聲，迫使這些豬閉口坐下。接著，羊群大聲咩叫「四足善，雙足惡」，喊聲持續近十五分鐘，終結所有討論的機會。

會後，尖叫者被派到農莊各處，針對此一新的安排向其他動物做解釋。

「同志們，」他說：「拿破崙同志將這份額外的差事往身上攬，我相信在場所有動物都很感謝他的犧牲。同志們，不要以為當領導是件樂事！正好相反，那是沉重的責任。沒有動物能像拿破崙同志這般堅信所有動物一律平等，你們想自己作主，他高興都來不及了，但你們有時可能會下錯誤的決定，到時我們該怎麼辦？現在我們知道雪球跟罪犯一樣壞，假設你們當初支持他還有那番風車蠢話，結果會怎樣呢？」

有動物說：「他在牛棚之戰中英勇戰鬥。」

「英勇是不夠的，」尖叫者回道：「忠誠與服從更重要。至於牛棚之戰，一段時日之後，我相信大家就會發現雪球的表現被誇大了。紀律，同志們，鐵的紀律！這就是今天的口號。一步走錯，敵人就會擊垮我們，同志們，你們不想讓瓊斯回來，對吧？」

這項論點再次讓動物們啞口無言，因為他們的確不希望瓊斯回來。如果週日朝會的辯論可能造成他重返農莊，那就該立即停止。拳擊手現在有時間好好思考，於是將自己的看法簡單說出來：「如果拿破崙同志這麼講，那就一定是對的。」從那時起，拳擊手除了座右銘「我要更努力」外，又將「拿破崙永遠是對的」當作格言謹記在心。

此時，氣候回暖，春耕也已展開。雪球繪製風車建造圖的廄棚如今大門深鎖，大家都認為地板上的建造圖已經擦掉了。每週日早上十點鐘，動物們都到大穀倉集合，接受新一週的工作指派。老少校的頭如今僅剩白骨，動物們將它從果園裡挖出來，放置在旗杆底下的台子上，就在槍旁邊。每次升完旗，動物們都得排成一列，恭敬地經過頭骨，再進入穀倉。現在，所有動物不像以前那樣全部坐在一起了，拿破崙、尖叫者以及一頭善於編歌寫詩、名叫小指的豬坐在高起平台的正前方，九條年輕的狗則以他們為中心圍成一個半圓。剩下的豬隻坐在後頭，其餘動物則坐在穀倉中央空地上。在聚會中，拿破崙以軍人般一板一眼的語氣宣讀下週工作指令，接著大家合唱一遍〈英格蘭之獸〉便告散會。

雪球遭到驅逐後的第三個週日，拿破崙宣布風車還是要建造，這讓動物們有點意外。拿破崙並未解釋自己為何改變心意，只提醒大家這份額外的任務將會非常艱辛，必要時可能還得減少食物配給。而建造計畫已經完全規劃好，沒漏掉任何細節，豬群所組成的專責委員會過去三週就是在處理這件事情。根據估計，建造風車加上其他各種改善工程總共得花兩年。

當晚，尖叫者私下向其他動物解釋，拿破崙實際上從未反對建造風車，相反地，這主意一開始是他提的。此外，雪球畫在孵蛋室地板上的建造圖其實是從拿破崙的文件中偷來的。事實上，風車是拿破崙的創作。有動物問道，為什麼他當時要強詞反對？此時尖叫者一臉狡猾地回說，這就是拿破崙同志精明之處，他看似反對風車，其實是趕走雪球的手段。雪球是個危險角色，只會帶來不良影響。現在，雪球走了，計畫就能不受干擾順利進行。尖叫者表示，這就是所謂的策略。「策略，同志們，策略！」他帶著愉悅的笑聲一連重複好幾次，邊講邊跳來蹦去、甩動尾巴。動物們不是很懂這個字眼，但尖叫者語氣太有說服力，再加上他身旁剛好有三條狗發出威脅性的低吼，所以大家都不再追問，接受了他的說法。



## Chapter 6

**ALL THAT YEAR THE animals worked like slaves. But they were happy in their work; they grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that everything that they did was for the benefit of themselves and those of their kind who would come after them, and not for a pack of idle, thieving human beings.**

Throughout the spring and summer they worked a sixty-hour week, and in August Napoleon announced that there would be work on Sunday afternoons as well. This work was strictly voluntary, but any animal who absented himself from it would have his rations reduced by half. Even so, it was found necessary to leave certain tasks undone. The harvest was a little less successful than in the previous year, and two fields which should have been sown with roots in the early summer were not sown because the ploughing had not been completed early enough. It was possible to foresee that the coming winter would be a hard one.

The windmill presented unexpected difficulties. There was a good quarry of limestone on the farm, and plenty of sand and cement had been found in one of the outhouses, so that all the materials for building were at hand. But the problem the animals could not at first solve was how to break up the stone into pieces of suitable size. There seemed no way of doing this except with picks and crowbars, which no animal could use, because no animal could stand on his hind legs. Only after weeks of vain effort did the right idea occur to somebody—namely, to utilise the force of gravity. Huge boulders, far too big to be used as they were, were lying all over the bed of the quarry. The animals lashed ropes round these, and then all together, cows, horses, sheep, any animal that could lay hold of the rope—even the pigs sometimes joined in at critical moments—they dragged them with desperate slowness up the slope to the top of the quarry, where they were toppled over the edge, to shatter to pieces below. Transporting the stone when it was once broken was comparatively simple. The horses carried it off in cart-loads, the sheep dragged single blocks, even Muriel and Benjamin yoked themselves into an old governess-cart and did their share. By late summer a sufficient store of stone had accumulated, and then the building began, under the superintendence of the pigs.

But it was a slow, laborious process. Frequently it took a whole day of exhausting effort to drag a single boulder to the top of the quarry, and sometimes when it was pushed over the edge it failed to break. Nothing could have been achieved without Boxer, whose strength seemed equal to that of all the rest of the animals put together. When the boulder began to slip and the animals cried out in despair at finding themselves dragged down the hill, it was always Boxer who strained himself against the rope and brought the boulder to a stop. To see him toiling up the slope inch by inch, his breath coming fast, the tips of his hoofs clawing at the ground, and his great sides matted with sweat, filled everyone with admiration. Clover warned him sometimes to be careful not to overstrain himself, but Boxer would never listen to her. His two slogans, "I will work harder" and "Napoleon is always right," seemed to him a sufficient answer to all problems. He had made arrangements with the cockerel to call him three-quarters of an hour earlier in the mornings instead of half an hour. And in his spare moments, of which there were not many nowadays, he would go alone to the quarry, collect a load of broken stone, and drag it down to the site of the windmill unassisted.

The animals were not badly off throughout that summer, in spite of the hardness of their work. If they had no more food than they had had in Jones's day, at least they did not have less. The advantage of only having to feed themselves, and not having to support five extravagant human beings as well, was so great that it would have taken a lot of failures to outweigh it. And in many ways the animal method of doing things was more efficient and saved labour. Such jobs as weeding, for instance, could be done with a thoroughness impossible to human beings. And again, since no animal now stole, it was unnecessary to fence off pasture from arable land, which saved a lot of labour on the upkeep of hedges and gates. Nevertheless, as the summer wore on, various unforeseen shortages began to make themselves felt. There was need of paraffin oil, nails, string, dog biscuits, and iron for the horses' shoes, none of which could be produced on the farm. Later there would also be need for seeds and artificial manures, besides various tools and, finally, the machinery for the windmill. How these were to be procured, no one was able to imagine.

**One Sunday morning, when the animals assembled to receive their orders, Napoleon announced that he had decided upon a new policy. From now onwards Animal Farm would engage in trade with the neighbouring farms: not, of course, for any commercial purpose, but simply in order to obtain certain materials which were urgently necessary. The needs of the windmill must override everything else, he said. He was therefore making arrangements to sell a stack of hay and part of the current year's wheat crop, and later on, if more money were needed, it would have to be made up by the sale of eggs, for which there was always a market in Willingdon. The hens, said Napoleon, should welcome this sacrifice as their own special contribution towards the building of the windmill.**

**Once again the animals were conscious of a vague uneasiness. Never to have any dealings with human beings, never to engage in trade, never to make use of money—had not these been among the earliest resolutions passed at that first triumphant Meeting after Jones was expelled? All the animals remembered passing such resolutions: or at least they thought that they remembered it. The four young pigs who had protested when Napoleon abolished the Meetings raised their voices timidly, but they were promptly silenced by a tremendous growling from the dogs. Then, as usual, the sheep broke into "Four legs good, two legs bad!" and the momentary awkwardness was smoothed over. Finally Napoleon raised his trotter for silence and announced that he had already made all the arrangements. There would be no need for any of the animals to come in contact with human beings, which would clearly be most undesirable. He intended to take the whole burden upon his own shoulders. A Mr. Whymper, a solicitor living in Willingdon, had agreed to act as intermediary between Animal Farm and the outside world, and would visit the farm every Monday morning to receive his instructions. Napoleon ended his speech with his usual cry of "Long live Animal Farm!" and after the singing of "Beasts of England" the animals were dismissed.**

**Afterwards Squealer made a round of the farm and set the animals' minds at rest. He assured them that the resolution against engaging in trade and using money had never been passed, or even suggested. It was pure imagination, probably traceable in the beginning to lies circulated by Snowball. A few animals still felt faintly doubtful, but Squealer asked them shrewdly, "Are you certain that this is not something that you have dreamed, comrades? Have you any record of such a resolution? Is it written down anywhere?" And since it was certainly true that nothing of the kind existed in writing, the animals were satisfied that they had been mistaken.**

Every Monday Mr. Whymper visited the farm as had been arranged. He was a sly-looking little man with side whiskers, a solicitor in a very small way of business, but sharp enough to have realised earlier than anyone else that Animal Farm would need a broker and that the commissions would be worth having. The animals watched his coming and going with a kind of dread, and avoided him as much as possible. **Nevertheless, the sight of Napoleon, on all fours, delivering orders to Whymper, who stood on two legs, roused their pride and partly reconciled them to the new arrangement. Their relations with the human race were now not quite the same as they had been before**. The human beings did not hate Animal Farm any less now that it was prospering; indeed, they hated it more than ever. Every human being held it as an article of faith that the farm would go bankrupt sooner or later, and, above all, that the windmill would be a failure. They would meet in the public-houses and prove to one another by means of diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it did stand up, then that it would never work. And yet, against their will, they had developed a certain respect for the efficiency with which the animals were managing their own affairs. One symptom of this was that they had begun to call Animal Farm by its proper name and ceased to pretend that it was called the Manor Farm. They had also dropped their championship of Jones, who had given up hope of getting his farm back and gone to live in another part of the county. Except through Whymper, there was as yet no contact between Animal Farm and the outside world, but there were constant rumours that Napoleon was about to enter into a definite business agreement either with Mr. Pilkington of Foxwood or with Mr. Frederick of Pinchfield—but never, it was noticed, with both simultaneously.

**It was about this time that the pigs suddenly moved into the farmhouse and took up their residence there. Again the animals seemed to remember that a resolution against this had been passed in the early days, and again Squealer was able to convince them that this was not the case. It was absolutely necessary, he said, that the pigs, who were the brains of the farm, should have a quiet place to work in. It was also more suited to the dignity of the Leader (for of late he had taken to speaking of Napoleon under the title of "Leader") to live in a house than in a mere sty. Nevertheless, some of the animals were disturbed when they heard that the pigs not only took their meals in the kitchen and used the drawing-room as a recreation room, but also slept in the beds**. Boxer passed it off as usual with "Napoleon is always right!", but Clover, who thought she remembered a definite ruling against beds, went to the end of the barn and tried to puzzle out the Seven Commandments which were inscribed there. Finding herself unable to read more than individual letters, she fetched Muriel.

"Muriel," she said, "read me the Fourth Commandment. Does it not say something about never sleeping in a bed?"

With some difficulty Muriel spelt it out.

"It says, 'No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets,'" she announced finally.

Curiously enough, Clover had not remembered that the Fourth Commandment mentioned sheets; but as it was there on the wall, it must have done so. And Squealer, who happened to be passing at this moment, attended by two or three dogs, was able to put the whole matter in its proper perspective.

"You have heard, then, comrades," he said, "that we pigs now sleep in the beds of the farmhouse? And why not? You did not suppose, surely, that there was ever a ruling against beds? A bed merely means a place to sleep in. A pile of straw in a stall is a bed, properly regarded. The rule was against sheets, which are a human invention. We have removed the sheets from the farmhouse beds, and sleep between blankets. And very comfortable beds they are too! But not more comfortable than we need, I can tell you, comrades, with all the brainwork we have to do nowadays. You would not rob us of our repose, would you, comrades? You would not have us too tired to carry out our duties? Surely none of you wishes to see Jones back?"

The animals reassured him on this point immediately, and no more was said about the pigs sleeping in the farmhouse beds. And when, some days afterwards, it was announced that from now on the pigs would get up an hour later in the morning than the other animals, no complaint was made about that either.

By the autumn the animals were tired but happy. They had had a hard year, and after the sale of part of the hay and corn, the stores of food for the winter were none too plentiful, but the windmill compensated for everything. It was almost half built now. After the harvest there was a stretch of clear dry weather, and the animals toiled harder than ever, thinking it well worth while to plod to and fro all day with blocks of stone if by doing so they could raise the walls another foot. Boxer would even come out at nights and work for an hour or two on his own by the light of the harvest moon. In their spare moments the animals would walk round and round the half-finished mill, admiring the strength and perpendicularity of its walls and marvelling that they should ever have been able to build anything so imposing. Only old Benjamin refused to grow enthusiastic about the windmill, though, as usual, he would utter nothing beyond the cryptic remark that donkeys live a long time.

November came, with raging south-west winds. Building had to stop because it was now too wet to mix the cement. Finally there came a night when the gale was so violent that the farm buildings rocked on their foundations and several tiles were blown off the roof of the barn. The hens woke up squawking with terror because they had all dreamed simultaneously of hearing a gun go off in the distance. In the morning the animals came out of their stalls to find that the flagstaff had been blown down and an elm tree at the foot of the orchard had been plucked up like a radish. They had just noticed this when a cry of despair broke from every animal's throat. A terrible sight had met their eyes. The windmill was in ruins.

With one accord they dashed down to the spot. Napoleon, who seldom moved out of a walk, raced ahead of them all. Yes, there it lay, the fruit of all their struggles, levelled to its foundations, the stones they had broken and carried so laboriously scattered all around. Unable at first to speak, they stood gazing mournfully at the litter of fallen stone. Napoleon paced to and fro in silence, occasionally snuffing at the ground. His tail had grown rigid and twitched sharply from side to side, a sign in him of intense mental activity. Suddenly he halted as though his mind were made up.

"Comrades," he said quietly, "do you know who is responsible for this? Do you know the enemy who has come in the night and overthrown our windmill? SNOWBALL!" he suddenly roared in a voice of thunder. "**Snowball has done this thing! In sheer malignity, thinking to set back our plans and avenge himself for his ignominious expulsion, this traitor has crept here under cover of night and destroyed our work of nearly a year. Comrades, here and now I pronounce the death sentence upon Snowball**. Animal Hero, Second Class,' and half a bushel of apples to any animal who brings him to justice. A full bushel to anyone who captures him alive!"

The animals were shocked beyond measure to learn that even Snowball could be guilty of such an action. There was a cry of indignation, and everyone began thinking out ways of catching Snowball if he should ever come back. Almost immediately the footprints of a pig were discovered in the grass at a little distance from the knoll. They could only be traced for a few yards, but appeared to lead to a hole in the hedge. Napoleon snuffed deeply at them and pronounced them to be Snowball's. He gave it as his opinion that Snowball had probably come from the direction of Foxwood Farm.

"No more delays, comrades!" cried Napoleon when the footprints had been examined. "There is work to be done. This very morning we begin rebuilding the windmill, and we will build all through the winter, rain or shine. We will teach this miserable traitor that he cannot undo our work so easily. Remember, comrades, there must be no alteration in our plans: they shall be carried out to the day. Forward, comrades! Long live the windmill! Long live Animal Farm!"

## 第 6 章

那一整年裡，動物們如奴隸般工作，但他們樂在其中，不遺餘力也不吝犧牲。他們很清楚這一切為的不是會偷走成果的怠惰人類，而是自己及後代子孫。

春夏兩季，動物們每週工作六十小時，到了八月，拿破崙宣布星期天下午也要工作，雖採完全志願制，但不參加的動物食物配給就會減半。即使到了這種地步，有些差事仍無暇顧及。收成不如去年豐碩，有兩塊地本來在初夏時分就該種植根莖作物，卻因沒有早點犁好而作罷。由此可想見，接下來的冬天將會很難熬。

建造風車的工程遇上意想不到的困難。農莊內有座藏量豐富的石灰岩礦場，動物們還在一間倉庫裡找到足夠的泥沙，建造風車所需材料一應俱全。然而，動物們首先面臨不知如何將石頭分割成適當大小的問題。這工作要用到十字鎬和鐵橇，但大家沒辦法以後腿站立，也就無法使用這兩樣工具。幾個星期徒勞無功之後，有隻動物想到了個好主意，那就是善用重力。無法直接取用的大石頭全擺在石灰岩礦場上，動物們拿繩子綁住，接著，牛、馬、羊等能夠拉繩的動物同心協力，必要的時候連豬也得加入，以極為緩慢的速度將石頭往礦場斜坡上拉，再從坡頂把石頭推下，將它摔成碎片。相較之下，搬運碎石比較輕鬆，馬一車車拉，羊一塊塊叼，就連穆里兒和班傑明也拖著老舊的雙輪馬車，運送自己負責的那一份。夏天接近尾聲時，動物們收集好足夠的石頭，建造工程旋即在豬群監督下展開。

不過，準備過程既緩慢又吃力，光把一塊石頭拉到礦場斜坡上往往就得耗掉一整天的精力，而且石頭推下來以後，有時還不見得碎裂。此外，倘若少了拳擊手，什麼活兒都完成不了，他的氣力可比其他動物的總合，當石頭下滑，連帶將大家往下拉時，其他動物絕望地吶喊，而拳擊手總會拉緊繩子，穩住下滑的石頭。看到拳擊手在坡道上艱辛而緩慢地移動，氣喘吁吁，蹄子緊抓地面，全身滿是汗水，所有動物莫不敬佩。幸運草有時會提醒他，不要把自己逼得太緊，但他老是不以為意，對他來說，「我要更努力」以及「拿破崙永遠是對的」這兩句口號足以解決所有問題。他原本和小公雞說好，要他每天早半小時叫他起床，現在變成提前四十五分鐘。儘管空閒時間不多，但是只要有機會，他就自個兒到礦場，收集一車碎石再拉到風車工地去，全程不靠其他動物幫忙。

雖說工作辛苦，動物們也不是整個夏天都過著水深火熱的生活，畢竟，就算他們的食物沒有多過瓊斯時代，至少不比當時差。只需餵飽自己，不用滿足五個奢侈人類，這是很大的優勢，失策不夠多還不至於產生影響。再說，從許多角度來看，動物做事情的方式更省時省力。舉例而言，除草之類的工作讓動物來做能比人類更為徹底。再說動物們現在不會偷吃，所以沒必要把牧場與耕地隔開，也因此不用維修籬笆和柵門，省下許多力氣。然而，夏天一天天過去，各種料想不到的短缺逐一浮現，煤油、釘子、繩子、狗餅乾以及鑄造馬蹄鐵所需的原料，這些物資農莊都無法生產。雖然有各種不同的工具，而且風車將帶來機械化，但是種子及化肥也將面臨短缺。對於要如何取得這些物資，動物們束手無策。

星期天早上，動物們集合接受工作指派，拿破崙宣布，他制定了一項新政策，從今以後，動物農莊要與鄰近農莊進行貿易，當然不是以商業買賣為目的，純粹是為了取得一些迫切需要的物資。他表示，沒有什麼比滿足建造風車所需更為重要。因此，拿破崙準備要賣一批乾草以及一部分今年收割的小麥，之後如果需要更多錢，那麼就得賣蛋，這種生意在威靈頓不怕沒買家。拿破崙說，這是母雞對於建造風車的特殊貢獻，理當欣然同意。

這一次，動物們又隱約感到不妥，不准和人類從事交易行為，不准做買賣、不准碰錢，這不是最初的決議嗎？早在成功趕走瓊斯後的第一次聚會中便拍板定案，所有動物都記得當初通過了這些決議，或者說，至少他們認為這件事情發生過。拿破崙廢除聚會時曾出言反對的那四頭年輕肉豬怯怯地提出異議，但馬上因為狗狺狺咆哮而住口。接著，羊群如往常一樣又突然大喊：「四足善，雙足惡！」使當時的尷尬氣氛隨之消散。最後，拿破崙舉起前蹄示意安靜，並宣布他已經安排妥當，動物們不用違背自己的心意與人類接觸，他會扛下這份重擔，而且住在威靈頓的溫普律師同意當動物農莊與外界之間的往來橋樑，每星期一早上會到農莊接受指示。語畢，拿破崙照例大喊：「動物農莊萬歲！」並在唱完〈英格蘭之獸〉後宣告散會。

會後，尖叫者整座農莊走了一回，安撫所有動物，他向動物們保證，當初並沒有通過禁止買賣、不得用錢的決議，甚至連提都沒提過，這完全是憑空想像，說不定是雪球造的謠。雖然有些動物仍存一絲疑惑，但尖叫者狡猾地問道：「同志們，你們確定不是作夢夢到的嗎？你們將決議記錄下來了嗎？決議白紙黑字寫在什麼地方了嗎？」因為這些決議的確沒有留下文字紀錄，所以動物們確信是自己記錯了。

每星期一，溫普先生都照約定前來農莊。他身材矮小，臉上蓄著落腮鬍，看起來老奸巨猾。身為律師，溫普主要經手極小規模業務，但敏銳的直覺讓他比其他人更早料想到動物農莊需要一名中間人，而且這工作將帶來豐厚的佣金。動物們看著他來來去去，心裡很是懼怕，無不盡可能避開他。不過，看著四腳站立的拿破崙對兩腳站立的溫普發號施令，令大家感到驕傲，也就多少對新政策釋懷了。現在他們跟人類的關係和以前大相逕庭，眼見動物農莊逐漸繁榮興盛，人類心頭恨意未曾稍減，事實上還更甚以往，每個人都相信動物農莊遲早會破產，而且風車工程會以失敗告終。人們常常在酒吧碰頭，以圖表向彼此證明風車會垮掉，就算真的建好也沒辦法運作。儘管人類內心心不甘情不願，但還是得承認動物們管理事務的效率令人佩服，這帶來一些效應，其中之一就是人類不再假裝農莊的名稱叫曼諾，而改採動物農莊這個較為恰當的字眼。他們也不再支持瓊斯，瓊斯則已放棄奪回農莊，搬到威靈頓其他地方去了。除了溫普先生，動物農莊與外界沒有任何聯繫，但有傳言說，拿破崙準備從狐林農莊的皮金頓先生和狹地農莊的腓特烈先生之間做選擇，簽訂具體貿易協定，但絕不會同時和這兩人簽約。

大概也是這個時候，豬群突然搬進農舍裡住了下來。動物們再次想起，以前曾經決議禁止這種作法，而尖叫者又再次讓他們相信事實不然。他表示，豬負責籌畫農莊大小事，絕對需要一個安靜的工作場所。再說，和豬圈比起來，屋子和尊貴的領袖（最近只要提到拿破崙，他就會加上領袖這個稱號）比較搭調。不過，一聽說豬隻不但在廚房用餐、把客廳當娛樂室，還睡在床上，有些動物感到很不快。拳擊手一如往常以「拿破崙永遠是對的」這句話帶過，但幸運草記得有明確規定禁止睡在床上，於是她跑到穀倉一角，試圖從寫在牆上的七誡看出端倪。幸運草只讀得懂個別字母，所以找來穆里兒。

「穆里兒，」幸運草說：「念第四誡給我聽。那一誡是不是說不能睡在床上？」

穆里兒費了些勁才將第四誡拼讀出來。

「上面是寫『不可睡於有床單的床上』。」她最後這麼說。

奇怪的是，幸運草完全不記得第四誡提到了床單，但是既然上面這樣寫，一定就是如此。此時，尖叫者在兩三條狗護衛下碰巧經過穀倉，於是特別釐清應該如何看待這整件事。

「同志們，你們已經聽說，」他說道：「我們豬群現在睡在農舍床上，對吧？這有何不可？你們該不會以為有什麼不准睡在床上的誡律吧？床不過是一個睡覺的地方，正確來說，廄棚裡的稻草堆也是床。誡律禁止的是床單，這是人類發明的東西。我們已經撤掉農舍裡每一張床的床單，只睡在毯子裡，這樣也夠舒適的了！但是，同志們，我可以跟你們說，和我們目前所進行的腦力工作相比，這種舒適度只是剛好而已。同志們，你們不會想讓我們不得安歇吧？你們不會想讓我們累到不能工作吧？你們都不希望看到瓊斯回來，對吧？」

動物們再次保證絕無此意，也不再對豬睡在農舍床上多說什麼。過了幾天，他們得知豬今後會晚一個小時起床，但也沒出言抱怨。

到了秋天，動物們雖疲憊卻開心，他們這一年過得很辛苦，賣掉部分乾草和穀物後，過冬用的貯備糧食並不十分充足。然而，風車建造計畫讓這一切都值得了。目前，風車蓋到一半，在秋收之後那段晴朗乾燥的日子裡，動物們吃力地搬運一塊塊石頭，幹的活比以往更重，但他們認為，只要這麼做能讓風車邊牆多個三十公分，那就夠了。拳擊手連晚上都待在外頭，在仲秋滿月的光芒照耀下，獨力工作一兩個小時。閒暇之餘，動物們一圈圈繞著蓋到一半的風車散步，讚佩邊牆堅固高聳、驚歎自己竟然能蓋出如此雄偉的建築物。只有老班傑明對風車冷眼看待，他還是老樣子，常常說驢子活很久之類令人費解的話。

進入十一月，西南風呼嘯，氣候潮濕影響水泥拌製，建造工程因而延宕。一天夜裡，暴風來襲，農莊倉舍被吹得搖搖晃晃，穀倉屋頂還有幾塊瓦片飛走了。母雞們聽到遠方一聲槍響，不約而同醒過來，驚慌地咕咕叫。隔天早上，動物們走出廄棚，發現旗杆吹斷了，果園一隅還有幾棵榆樹像蘿蔔般被連根拔起。接著，動物們把注意力轉移到另一個地方，紛紛發出絕望的鳴叫，慘不忍賭的景象映入眼簾—風車垮掉了。

動物們一窩蜂往工地跑，一向緩步徐行的拿破崙衝在最前面。沒錯，全塌了。大家付出血汗的成果被夷為平地，那些摔碎後再費力運來的石頭散落四處。動物們起先說不出話來，只是站在原地、悲傷地盯著地上的亂石。拿破崙一語不發地來回走動，時而嗅聞地面，僵直的尾巴迅速地左右甩動，這代表他正在沉思。突然間，他停下來，彷彿已釐清頭緒。

「同志們，」他平靜地說：「你們知道這是誰幹的好事嗎？你們知道是哪個敵人晚上到這裡破壞風車嗎？是雪球！」拿破崙忽然大叫，聲音像雷一樣響亮：「這是雪球幹的！他就是不安好心眼，想破壞我們的計畫，報自己被狼狽趕走之仇。這個叛徒在夜色掩護下潛進這裡，摧毀我們近一年的成果。同志們，我在此時此地宣判雪球死刑。將雪球就地正法的動物可獲得『動物英雄二等勳章』以及半蒲式耳蘋果，活捉他的可獲得一蒲式耳蘋果！」

一聽到是雪球犯下的惡行，動物們十分震驚，憤慨之聲不絕於耳，各個都想盡辦法要在雪球回來的時候抓住他。沒多久，山丘附近的草地上發現豬的足跡，雖然蹄印只有幾公尺，但顯然是往籬笆破洞的方向去，拿破崙使勁聞著，並對大家說這是雪球所留，他認為雪球大概是從狐林農莊那個方向過來的。

「同志們，不要再拖延了！」調查完足跡以後，拿破崙喊道：「我們還有事情得做，從今天早上起，我們要重建風車，冬天、雨天、豔陽天都不休息。我們要給這叛徒一個教訓，讓他知道，要破壞我們的計畫沒那麼容易。同志們，記住，我們的計畫絕不改變，而且要即刻展開。同志們，前進！風車萬歲！動物農莊萬歲！」


## Chapter 7


IT WAS A BITTER WINTER. The stormy weather was followed by sleet and snow, and then by a hard frost which did not break till well into February. The animals carried on as best they could with the rebuilding of the windmill, well knowing that the outside world was watching them and that the envious human beings would rejoice and triumph if the mill were not finished on time.

Out of spite, the human beings pretended not to believe that it was Snowball who had destroyed the windmill: they said that it had fallen down because the walls were too thin. The animals knew that this was not the case. Still, it had been decided to build the walls three feet thick this time instead of eighteen inches as before, which meant collecting much larger quantities of stone. For a long time the quarry was full of snowdrifts and nothing could be done. Some progress was made in the dry frosty weather that followed, but it was cruel work, and the animals could not feel so hopeful about it as they had felt before. They were always cold, and usually hungry as well. Only Boxer and Clover never lost heart. **Squealer made excellent speeches on the joy of service and the dignity of labour, but the other animals found more inspiration in Boxer's strength and his never-failing cry of "I will work harder!"**

**In January food fell short. The corn ration was drastically reduced, and it was announced that an extra potato ration would be issued to make up for it. Then it was discovered that the greater part of the potato crop had been frosted in the clamps, which had not been covered thickly enough. The potatoes had become soft and discoloured, and only a few were edible. For days at a time the animals had nothing to eat but chaff and mangels. Starvation seemed to stare them in the face.**

**It was vitally necessary to conceal this fact from the outside world. Emboldened by the collapse of the windmill, the human beings were inventing fresh lies about Animal Farm. Once again it was being put about that all the animals were dying of famine and disease, and that they were continually fighting among themselves and had resorted to cannibalism and infanticide. Napoleon was well aware of the bad results that might follow if the real facts of the food situation were known, and he decided to make use of Mr. Whymper to spread a contrary impression. Hitherto the animals had had little or no contact with Whymper on his weekly visits: now, however, a few selected animals, mostly sheep, were instructed to remark casually in his hearing that rations had been increased. In addition, Napoleon ordered the almost empty bins in the store-shed to be filled nearly to the brim with sand, which was then covered up with what remained of the grain and meal. On some suitable pretext Whymper was led through the store-shed and allowed to catch a glimpse of the bins. He was deceived, and continued to report to the outside world that there was no food shortage on Animal Farm.**

Nevertheless, towards the end of January it became obvious that it would be necessary to procure some more grain from somewhere. In these days Napoleon rarely appeared in public, but spent all his time in the farmhouse, which was guarded at each door by fierce-looking dogs. When he did emerge, it was in a ceremonial manner, with an escort of six dogs who closely surrounded him and growled if anyone came too near. Frequently he did not even appear on Sunday mornings, but issued his orders through one of the other pigs, usually Squealer.

One Sunday morning Squealer announced that the hens, who had just come in to lay again, must surrender their eggs. Napoleon had accepted, through Whymper, a contract for four hundred eggs a week. The price of these would pay for enough grain and meal to keep the farm going till summer came on and conditions were easier.

When the hens heard this, they raised a terrible outcry. They had been warned earlier that this sacrifice might be necessary, but had not believed that it would really happen. They were just getting their clutches ready for the spring sitting, and they protested that to take the eggs away now was murder. For the first time since the expulsion of Jones, there was something resembling a rebellion. Led by three young Black Minorca pullets, the hens made a determined effort to thwart Napoleon's wishes. Their method was to fly up to the rafters and there lay their eggs, which smashed to pieces on the floor. **Napoleon acted swiftly and ruthlessly. He ordered the hens' rations to be stopped, and decreed that any animal giving so much as a grain of corn to a hen should be punished by death. The dogs saw to it that these orders were carried out. For five days the hens held out, then they capitulated and went back to their nesting boxes. Nine hens had died in the meantime. Their bodies were buried in the orchard, and it was given out that they had died of coccidiosis. Whymper heard nothing of this affair, and the eggs were duly delivered, a grocer's van driving up to the farm once a week to take them away.**

All this while no more had been seen of Snowball. He was rumoured to be hiding on one of the neighbouring farms, either Foxwood or Pinchfield. Napoleon was by this time on slightly better terms with the other farmers than before. It happened that there was in the yard a pile of timber which had been stacked there ten years earlier when a beech spinney was cleared. It was well seasoned, and Whymper had advised Napoleon to sell it; both Mr. Pilkington and Mr. Frederick were anxious to buy it. Napoleon was hesitating between the two, unable to make up his mind. **It was noticed that whenever he seemed on the point of coming to an agreement with Frederick, Snowball was declared to be in hiding at Foxwood, while, when he inclined toward Pilkington, Snowball was said to be at Pinchfield.**

Suddenly, early in the spring, an alarming thing was discovered. Snowball was secretly frequenting the farm by night! The animals were so disturbed that they could hardly sleep in their stalls. Every night, it was said, he came creeping in under cover of darkness and performed all kinds of mischief. He stole the corn, he upset the milkpails, he broke the eggs, he trampled the seedbeds, he gnawed the bark off the fruit trees. Whenever anything went wrong it became usual to attribute it to Snowball. If a window was broken or a drain was blocked up, someone was certain to say that Snowball had come in the night and done it, and when the key of the store-shed was lost, the whole farm was convinced that Snowball had thrown it down the well. Curiously enough, they went on believing this even after the mislaid key was found under a sack of meal. The cows declared unanimously that Snowball crept into their stalls and milked them in their sleep. The rats, which had been troublesome that winter, were also said to be in league with Snowball.

Napoleon decreed that there should be a full investigation into Snowball's activities. With his dogs in attendance he set out and made a careful tour of inspection of the farm buildings, the other animals following at a respectful distance. At every few steps Napoleon stopped and snuffed the ground for traces of Snowball's footsteps, which, he said, he could detect by the smell. He snuffed in every corner, in the barn, in the cowshed, in the hen-houses, in the vegetable garden, and found traces of Snowball almost everywhere. He would put his snout to the ground, give several deep sniffs, and exclaim in a terrible voice, "Snowball! He has been here! I can smell him distinctly!" and at the word "Snowball" all the dogs let out blood-curdling growls and showed their side teeth.

The animals were thoroughly frightened. It seemed to them as though Snowball were some kind of invisible influence, pervading the air about them and menacing them with all kinds of dangers. In the evening Squealer called them together, and with an alarmed expression on his face told them that he had some serious news to report.

**"Comrades!" cried Squealer, making little nervous skips, "a most terrible thing has been discovered. Snowball has sold himself to Frederick of Pinchfield Farm, who is even now plotting to attack us and take our farm away from us! Snowball is to act as his guide when the attack begins. But there is worse than that. We had thought that Snowball's rebellion was caused simply by his vanity and ambition. But we were wrong, comrades. Do you know what the real reason was? Snowball was in league with Jones from the very start! He was Jones's secret agent all the time. It has all been proved by documents which he left behind him and which we have only just discovered. To my mind this explains a great deal, comrades. Did we not see for ourselves how he attempted—fortunately without success—to get us defeated and destroyed at the Battle of the Cowshed?"**

The animals were stupefied. This was a wickedness far outdoing Snowball's destruction of the windmill. But it was some minutes before they could fully take it in. They all remembered, or thought they remembered, how they had seen Snowball charging ahead of them at the Battle of the Cowshed, how he had rallied and encouraged them at every turn, and how he had not paused for an instant even when the pellets from Jones's gun had wounded his back. At first it was a little difficult to see how this fitted in with his being on Jones's side. Even Boxer, who seldom asked questions, was puzzled. He lay down, tucked his fore hoofs beneath him, shut his eyes, and with a hard effort managed to formulate his thoughts.

"I do not believe that," he said. "Snowball fought bravely at the Battle of the Cowshed. I saw him myself. Did we not give him 'Animal Hero, First Class,' immediately afterwards?"

"That was our mistake, comrade. For we know now—it is all written down in the secret documents that we have found—that in reality he was trying to lure us to our doom."

"But he was wounded," said Boxer. "We all saw him running with blood."

"That was part of the arrangement!" cried Squealer. "Jones's shot only grazed him. I could show you this in his own writing, if you were able to read it. The plot was for Snowball, at the critical moment, to give the signal for flight and leave the field to the enemy. And he very nearly succeeded—I will even say, comrades, he would have succeeded if it had not been for our heroic Leader, Comrade Napoleon. Do you not remember how, just at the moment when Jones and his men had got inside the yard, Snowball suddenly turned and fled, and many animals followed him? And do you not remember, too, that it was just at that moment, when panic was spreading and all seemed lost, that Comrade Napoleon sprang forward with a cry of 'Death to Humanity!' and sank his teeth in Jones's leg? Surely you remember that, comrades?" exclaimed Squealer, frisking from side to side.

Now when Squealer described the scene so graphically, it seemed to the animals that they did remember it. At any rate, they remembered that at the critical moment of the battle Snowball had turned to flee. But Boxer was still a little uneasy.

"I do not believe that Snowball was a traitor at the beginning," he said finally. "What he has done since is different. But I believe that at the Battle of the Cowshed he was a good comrade."

"Our Leader, Comrade Napoleon," announced Squealer, speaking very slowly and firmly, "has stated categorically—categorically, comrade—that Snowball was Jones's agent from the very beginning—yes, and from long before the Rebellion was ever thought of."

"Ah, that is different!" said Boxer. "If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right."

"That is the true spirit, comrade!" cried Squealer, but it was noticed he cast a very ugly look at Boxer with his little twinkling eyes. He turned to go, then paused and added impressively: "I warn every animal on this farm to keep his eyes very wide open. For we have reason to think that some of Snowball's secret agents are lurking among us at this moment!"

Four days later, in the late afternoon, Napoleon ordered all the animals to assemble in the yard. When they were all gathered together, Napoleon emerged from the farmhouse, wearing both his medals (for he had recently awarded himself "Animal Hero, First Class," and "Animal Hero, Second Class"), with his nine huge dogs frisking round him and uttering growls that sent shivers down all the animals' spines. They all cowered silently in their places, seeming to know in advance that some terrible thing was about to happen.

Napoleon stood sternly surveying his audience; then he uttered a high-pitched whimper. Immediately the dogs bounded forward, seized four of the pigs by the ear and dragged them, squealing with pain and terror, to Napoleon's feet. The pigs' ears were bleeding, the dogs had tasted blood, and for a few moments they appeared to go quite mad. To the amazement of everybody, three of them flung themselves upon Boxer. Boxer saw them coming and put out his great hoof, caught a dog in mid-air, and pinned him to the ground. The dog shrieked for mercy and the other two fled with their tails between their legs. Boxer looked at Napoleon to know whether he should crush the dog to death or let it go. Napoleon appeared to change countenance, and sharply ordered Boxer to let the dog go, whereat Boxer lifted his hoof, and the dog slunk away, bruised and howling.

**Presently the tumult died down. The four pigs waited, trembling, with guilt written on every line of their countenances. Napoleon now called upon them to confess their crimes. They were the same four pigs as had protested when Napoleon abolished the Sunday Meetings. Without any further prompting they confessed that they had been secretly in touch with Snowball ever since his expulsion, that they had collaborated with him in destroying the windmill, and that they had entered into an agreement with him to hand over Animal Farm to Mr. Frederick. They added that Snowball had privately admitted to them that he had been Jones's secret agent for years past. When they had finished their confession, the dogs promptly tore their throats out, and in a terrible voice Napoleon demanded whether any other animal had anything to confess.**

**The three hens who had been the ringleaders in the attempted rebellion over the eggs now came forward and stated that Snowball had appeared to them in a dream and incited them to disobey Napoleon's orders. They, too, were slaughtered. Then a goose came forward and confessed to having secreted six ears of corn during the last year's harvest and eaten them in the night. Then a sheep confessed to having urinated in the drinking pool—urged to do this, so she said, by Snowball—and two other sheep confessed to having murdered an old ram, an especially devoted follower of Napoleon, by chasing him round and round a bonfire when he was suffering from a cough. They were all slain on the spot. And so the tale of confessions and executions went on, until there was a pile of corpses lying before Napoleon's feet and the air was heavy with the smell of blood, which had been unknown there since the expulsion of Jones.**

When it was all over, the remaining animals, except for the pigs and dogs, crept away in a body. They were shaken and miserable. They did not know which was more shocking—the treachery of the animals who had leagued themselves with Snowball, or the cruel retribution they had just witnessed. In the old days there had often been scenes of bloodshed equally terrible, but it seemed to all of them that it was far worse now that it was happening among themselves. Since Jones had left the farm, until today, no animal had killed another animal. Not even a rat had been killed. They had made their way on to the little knoll where the half-finished windmill stood, and with one accord they all lay down as though huddling together for warmth—Clover, Muriel, Benjamin, the cows, the sheep, and a whole flock of geese and hens—everyone, indeed, except the cat, who had suddenly disappeared just before Napoleon ordered the animals to assemble. For some time nobody spoke. Only Boxer remained on his feet. He fidgeted to and fro, swishing his long black tail against his sides and occasionally uttering a little whinny of surprise. Finally he said:

"I do not understand it. I would not have believed that such things could happen on our farm. It must be due to some fault in ourselves. The solution, as I see it, is to work harder. From now onwards I shall get up a full hour earlier in the mornings."

And he moved off at his lumbering trot and made for the quarry. Having got there, he collected two successive loads of stone and dragged them down to the windmill before retiring for the night.

The animals huddled about Clover, not speaking. The knoll where they were lying gave them a wide prospect across the countryside. Most of Animal Farm was within their view—the long pasture stretching down to the main road, the hayfield, the spinney, the drinking pool, the ploughed fields where the young wheat was thick and green, and the red roofs of the farm buildings with the smoke curling from the chimneys. It was a clear spring evening. The grass and the bursting hedges were gilded by the level rays of the sun. Never had the farm—and with a kind of surprise they remembered that it was their own farm, every inch of it their own property—appeared to the animals so desirable a place. As Clover looked down the hillside her eyes filled with tears. If she could have spoken her thoughts, it would have been to say that this was not what they had aimed at when they had set themselves years ago to work for the overthrow of the human race. These scenes of terror and slaughter were not what they had looked forward to on that night when old Major first stirred them to rebellion. If she herself had had any picture of the future, it had been of a society of animals set free from hunger and the whip, all equal, each working according to his capacity, the strong protecting the weak, as she had protected the lost brood of ducklings with her foreleg on the night of Major's speech. Instead—she did not know why—they had come to a time when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed everywhere, and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after confessing to shocking crimes. There was no thought of rebellion or disobedience in her mind. She knew that, even as things were, they were far better off than they had been in the days of Jones, and that before all else it was needful to prevent the return of the human beings. Whatever happened she would remain faithful, work hard, carry out the orders that were given to her, and accept the leadership of Napoleon. But still, it was not for this that she and all the other animals had hoped and toiled. It was not for this that they had built the windmill and faced the bullets of Jones's gun. Such were her thoughts, though she lacked the words to express them.

At last, feeling this to be in some way a substitute for the words she was unable to find, she began to sing "Beasts of England." The other animals sitting round her took it up, and they sang it three times over—very tunefully, but slowly and mournfully, in a way they had never sung it before.

**They had just finished singing it for the third time when Squealer, attended by two dogs, approached them with the air of having something important to say. He announced that, by a special decree of Comrade Napoleon, "Beasts of England" had been abolished. From now onwards it was forbidden to sing it.**

The animals were taken aback.

"Why?" cried Muriel.

**"It's no longer needed, comrade," said Squealer stiffly. "'Beasts of England' was the song of the Rebellion. But the Rebellion is now completed. The execution of the traitors this afternoon was the final act. The enemy both external and internal has been defeated. In 'Beasts of England' we expressed our longing for a better society in days to come. But that society has now been established. Clearly this song has no longer any purpose."**

Frightened though they were, some of the animals might possibly have protested, but at this moment the sheep set up their usual bleating of "Four legs good, two legs bad," which went on for several minutes and put an end to the discussion.

So "Beasts of England" was heard no more. In its place Minimus, the poet, had composed another song which began:

Animal Farm, Animal Farm,

Never through me shalt thou come to harm!

and this was sung every Sunday morning after the hoisting of the flag. But somehow neither the words nor the tune ever seemed to the animals to come up to "Beasts of England."

## 第 7 章

這年冬天分外難熬，尾隨暴風來的是凍雨以及大雪。接著，寒霜凍結大地，一直到二月才逐漸溶化。動物們使盡全力重建風車，因為他們很清楚外界都在看好戲，如果不能如期完工，妒火中燒的人類肯定得意叫好。

壞心腸的人類壓根兒不相信雪球是兇手的說法，他們認為牆太薄弱才是主因，儘管動物們知道並非如此，但仍決定這次牆壁厚度要從先前的四十五公分增加到一公尺，這也意味著他們得採集更多石頭。礦場積雪好一段時間了，大家什麼事情都沒法做。接下來雖然仍有寒霜，但氣候較為乾燥，動物們趁機工作，處境十分艱辛，使得他們不如往常般樂觀。飢寒交迫之下，只有拳擊手和幸運草沒有失去信心。尖叫者憑著他那三寸不爛之舌，鼓吹為農莊效力之喜悅與付出勞力之尊貴。然而，真正激勵其他動物的是拳擊手的氣力，還有他一聲聲「我要更努力！」的叫喊，他的語氣永遠那麼堅定。

一月，食物短缺，穀物配給大幅縮水，原本說要以馬鈴薯替代，後來發現大部分馬鈴薯因當初種得不夠深而受到霜害。這些馬鈴薯既軟又爛且顏色異常，只有少部分能食用。結果動物們常常一連好幾天只吃粗糠和甜菜，饑荒近在眼前。

這件事情絕對不能讓外界知道，風車崩毀壯了人類的膽，有關動物農莊的謠言又起，再度有人聲稱農莊裡的動物即將餓死、病死，不但互相攻擊，還吃食同類、殘殺幼獸。拿破崙深知缺糧危機被人類知道會有什麼後果，於是決定利用溫普先生散布相反的消息。如今，溫普先生仍舊每週造訪農莊一次，但動物們從不和他往來，就算有，次數也屈指可數。現在，拿破崙挑了一些動物，其中大多是綿羊，他們在溫普身邊故作若無其事地談話，讓他以為農莊的食物配給增加了。事實上，貯糧庫的貯糧桶幾乎見底，拿破崙於是要動物用沙填滿，再把剩餘的穀物、玉米粉鋪在上面。接著編了套適當的說詞帶溫普到貯糧庫晃一圈，更讓他看了幾眼貯糧桶。溫普因而被矇騙，繼續向外界表示動物農莊沒有缺糧危機。

然而，到了一月底，從他處取得更多穀物已是勢在必行。這些日子裡，拿破崙甚少露面，幾乎只待在農舍裡，每道門皆有外表凶猛的大狗看守。拿破崙每次現身都很隆重，像是舉行典禮一般，六條狗護衛左右，誰靠得太近就吼叫。星期天早晨集會也經常不見拿破崙身影，命令總交由其他豬宣布，通常是尖叫者代勞。

某個星期天早晨，尖叫者要剛下完蛋的母雞交出雞蛋。在溫普仲介之下，拿破崙接受了一份每週提供四百顆蛋的合約，買賣所得將用來購入足夠的穀物，讓農莊運作得以撐到夏天，缺糧情勢也能緩和下來。

母雞一聽聞此事便強烈反對，之前就有動物提醒她們或許得做這樣的犧牲，但她們從不相信會成真。母雞們此時剛把春天要孵的蛋準備好，所以紛紛抗議說現在把蛋拿走根本就是謀殺。自瓊斯遭到驅逐以來，這是農莊內首次幾近抗爭的行動，母雞們在三隻年輕的米諾卡黑雞帶領下抵死不從，她們想到的法子是飛到屋椽上下蛋，讓蛋摔破在地上。拿破崙於是展開迅速而無情的反制行動，他下令停止提供母雞食物，更揚言處死任何給母雞糧食的動物，一穀一粟都不行，此命令由狗負責執行。母雞堅持了五天，最後終於屈服，回到雞舍。這段時間死了九隻雞，屍體葬在果園內，對外則宣稱是死於球蟲症。這件事情並未傳到溫普耳裡，農莊每週按時交蛋，由食品商的馬車載走。

這陣子皆不見雪球蹤影，大家傳說他躲在鄰近農莊內，不是狐林就是狹地。而拿破崙和其他農人的關係此時也稍有好轉，正巧院子裡疊了一堆木材，為十年前清理櫸樹林所留，這時已經完全風乾，溫普便建議拿破崙賣掉這些木材。皮金頓先生和腓特烈先生爭相要收購，讓拿破崙下不了決定。大家發現，每當拿破崙打算賣給腓特烈時，就有消息說雪球在狐林農莊，而當他想賣給皮金頓時，狹地農莊就被傳作是雪球的落腳處。

早春時分，有件事情讓農莊陷入恐慌，那就是雪球晚上常常回來！廄棚內的動物受到干擾，難以入睡。大家說，雪球在暗夜掩護下潛進來，做各種壞事。他偷穀物、打翻牛奶桶、弄破雞蛋、踐踏苗圃還咬掉果樹樹皮，只要出問題，通常是雪球幹的。如果窗戶玻璃破了或者排水系統堵住，就會有動物言之鑿鑿地說是雪球晚上跑回來了。當貯糧庫的鑰匙不見時，全莊動物一致認為是雪球把鑰匙丟到井裡。好笑的是，就算事後在一袋玉米粉底下找回當初放錯地方的鑰匙，大家還是這麼相信。此外，乳牛集體表示，雪球趁她們睡覺的時候偷跑進棚內擠她們的奶。更有甚者，在冬天製造不少麻煩的老鼠成了雪球同夥。

拿破崙下令清查雪球所有活動，在狗群隨侍下，他動身前往各倉舍，仔仔細細地檢查了一番，其他動物跟在後面，恭敬地保持一定距離。拿破崙每走幾步就停下來嗅一嗅，說是雪球如果在地上留下蹄印，他一聞就聞得出來。他嗅遍每個角落，從穀倉、牛棚、雞舍到菜園，幾乎所有地方都發現雪球的蹤跡。拿破崙將鼻子靠近地面，深深地嗅，然後語氣可怖地大叫：「雪球！他來過這裡！我聞得清清楚楚！」「雪球」兩個字一出口，所有的狗就齜牙咧嘴咆哮不停，動物們聽在耳裡血液簡直立即凍結。

大家完全嚇壞了，對他們來說，雪球彷彿成了某種無形的影響力，滲透進周遭空氣中，以各種不同的危險形式構成威脅。當天晚上，尖叫者把所有動物集合在一起，面帶驚懼地說他有個重要的消息。

「同志們！」尖叫者一邊緊張地跳來蹦去，一邊高喊：「我們發現一件最可怕的事情，雪球投靠狹地農莊的腓特烈了，現在正計畫攻擊我們、奪走農莊，而且進行攻擊時，雪球會當他們的嚮導。更糟糕的是，我們以為雪球背叛只是因為他愛慕虛榮、野心勃勃，但我們錯了。同志們，你們知道真正的原因是什麼嗎？雪球從一開始就和瓊斯狼狽為奸！他一直是瓊斯的密探，我們剛剛發現雪球留下的一些文件，裡面就能找到證據。同志們，在我看來，這解釋了很多疑點。在牛棚之戰中，雖然他詭計沒有得逞，但我們親眼看到他是如何想讓我們吃敗仗的，不是嗎？」

動物們呆若木雞，雪球做這件事情比他破壞風車要可惡得多。但大家花了幾分鐘才完全接受尖叫者說的話，因為動物們記得，或者認為自己記得，雪球在牛棚之戰帶領大家攻擊人類，每波攻勢都忙著重整、鼓勵大家，即便被瓊斯的槍彈射傷了背仍舊毫不退縮。起初，大家很難把雪球這樣的舉動聯想成他是瓊斯的手下，就連甚少發問的拳擊手也感到困惑。他趴了下來，前腳縮到身體底下，閉上眼費力苦思。

「我不相信，」他說：「雪球在牛棚之戰表現英勇，這是我親眼目睹的，我們在戰後不是還立即頒給他『動物英雄一等勳章』嗎？」

「同志，這是我們搞錯了，這全記載在我們發現的密件裡面，我們現在知道他當時其實是要引誘我們走向滅亡。」

「但是他受傷了，」拳擊手回道：「我們都看到他流著血衝向瓊斯。」

「這是他們的安排！」尖叫者嚷道：「瓊斯那一槍只是剛好擦過他的身體，如果你識字的話，我可以給你看雪球的親筆紀錄。他們的計畫是，要雪球在重要時刻逃跑，把農莊留給敵人，而雪球差點得逞了。同志們，我甚至得說，要不是我們有英明的領袖拿破崙同志在，他早就得逞了。瓊斯跟他的手下進入院子時，你們記得雪球突然轉身逃跑，而且有很多動物跟著他逃離戰場嗎？另外，當大家陷入恐慌，眼看大勢已去的時候，拿破崙同志一躍而出，高喊『殺死人類！』，並且一口往瓊斯的腿咬，這件事大家也不記得了嗎？同志們，你們都還記得，對吧？」尖叫者跳來蹦去地喊著。

尖叫者如此生動地描述當時情景，讓動物們以為自己對這一幕留有印象。不管怎麼說，他們記得雪球在大戰關鍵時刻確曾掉頭就跑。但是，拳擊手依舊有點不服。

「我不相信雪球從一開始就是個叛徒，」他最後開口說道：「他之後的所作所為是另一回事，但在牛棚之戰中，雪球是個好同志。」

「我們的領袖拿破崙同志很明確地表示，」尖叫者以緩慢而堅定的口吻說道：「同志，他明明白白地說了，雪球從最開始就是瓊斯的密探。沒錯，早在大家興起抗爭這個念頭之前就是了。」

「噢，那就不一樣了！」拳擊手回道：「如果拿破崙同志這麼講，那一定是對的。」

「同志，這樣的想法就對了！」尖叫者叫道，大家注意到他閃爍的小眼睛厭惡地瞥了拳擊手一下，接著轉身便要離去，卻突然又停下來，講了幾句讓動物們印象深刻的話：「我想提醒農莊內的每隻動物保持警戒，我們有理由懷疑，雪球的密探此刻正潛伏在我們身邊！」

四天後，接近傍晚時，拿破崙要所有動物到院子裡集合。等大家到齊後，拿破崙從農舍中走出來，身上佩戴著兩面勳章（他最近頒給自己「動物英雄一等勳章」和「動物英雄二等勳章」），手下九條大狗在身邊蹦跳還不時吼叫，嚇得動物們背脊發抖。大家安靜地縮在自己的位置上，彷彿預感到可怕的事情即將發生。

拿破崙嚴厲的目光掃視底下的動物，接著尖嘯一聲，身邊的狗立即跳上前去，一口咬住四隻豬的耳朵，不顧他們因疼痛與恐懼而發出的慘叫，把他們拖到拿破崙跟前。豬的耳朵流出鮮血，狗嚐到血的滋味，頓時更加瘋狂，其中三條狗此時往拳擊手身上撲過去，讓動物們大吃一驚。拳擊手看到狗撲過來，舉起大蹄子一腳將一條還在半空中的狗壓到地上，結果這條狗哀聲求饒，其他兩條也夾著尾巴逃跑了。拳擊手看了看拿破崙，想知道自己該踩死這條狗還是放他走。最後，他舉起蹄子，受了傷的狗便哀叫著逃離了。

這時，喧譁聲靜止，四頭豬渾身顫抖地等待著，臉上滿是罪惡感。此時，拿破崙要他們承認自己的罪行。其實他們就是當初拿破崙說要廢除星期天聚會時出言抗議的那四頭豬，不消進一步逼問，這些豬便坦承和雪球有祕密接觸，而且從他被驅逐的那天就開始了。他們一起破壞風車，還協議要將動物農莊送給腓特烈先生，雪球更私下向他們承認自己當瓊斯的密探已經好幾年。這四頭豬話一說完，馬上便被狗咬斷喉嚨。接著，拿破崙以十分可怕的聲音查問，是否有其他動物要坦承什麼事情。

雞蛋抗爭事件中帶頭的三隻母雞站了出來，說雪球曾來到她們夢中，要她們違反拿破崙的命令，結果她們也被殺了。之後，一隻鵝坦承他在去年收成時偷藏了六穗小麥，趁晚上吃掉。一頭綿羊坦承在飲水池裡小便，她說是雪球叫她這麼做的。語畢，又有兩頭綿羊坦承謀殺了一頭老公羊，這頭公羊是拿破崙的忠實追隨者，卻在咳嗽咳得厲害的時候被他們追著跑，在火堆旁繞啊繞，最後不幸喪命。這些動物皆被當場處死，還有許多動物也在坦承罪行之後處決。拿破崙跟前屍體堆積如山，空氣中瀰漫著濃厚的血腥味，這是自從瓊斯被驅逐以來就不曾出現過的氣味。

告解結束後，除了豬和狗以外，其他還活著的動物膽顫心驚地離開院子，他們飽受驚嚇、悲痛欲絕，但不知道哪件事情比較震撼—是遭到與雪球狼狽為奸的動物背叛？還是親眼目睹的殘酷懲罰？以前常常有這樣血腥的場景，但動物們覺得這一次更糟糕，因為是發生在動物之間。自從瓊斯離開農莊至今，沒有動物殺害過另一隻動物，連老鼠也沒死過半隻。動物們來到小山丘上，蓋到一半的風車還矗立在這裡，大家不約而同地趴下來，幸運草、穆里兒、班傑明、牛、羊還有一大群鵝和雞靠在一起取暖。實際上，所有動物都聚在這裡，除了貓以外，她在拿破崙命令大家集合之前就突然消失了。動物們沉默了好一段時間。只有拳擊手依舊站著，他煩躁地來回踱步，沙沙地甩動又長又黑的尾巴，時而發出細微的驚叫。最後，他說：

「我不了解，我不相信這種事情會發生在我們農莊裡，一定是我們哪裡做錯了，在我看來，只有更努力工作才是解決之道。從現在起，我每天早上都要整整早起一個小時。」

接著拳擊手步伐笨重地往礦場跑，到了那裡就不停工作，一連拉了兩車石頭到風車工地，直到晚上才休息。

其他動物靠在幸運草身旁，不發一語。他們所在的小山丘視野遼闊，整座動物農莊幾乎盡收眼底，狹長的牧場一直延伸到大馬路、乾草地、雜樹叢、飲水池。遠遠的那頭，耕地裡長著茁壯而青嫩的麥苗，農莊倉舍的紅色屋頂上有裊裊白煙從煙囪冒出來。這是個清朗的春季傍晚，青草和茂盛的樹籬在夕陽餘暉下閃閃發光，他們從來不曾像現在這般想要擁有這塊地方，而且還很驚訝地想到，這本來就是他們的農莊，這裡的每一寸土地都歸他們所有。幸運草往山坡下看，眼中盈滿淚水，如果她能夠將心情訴諸於言語，大概就是，這和幾年前推翻人類時的初衷大相逕庭。在老少校鼓動大家抗爭的那晚，恐懼和殘殺絕不在他們的期待之內。如果要她勾勒出一幅未來的景象，那會是個美好的社會，動物不再挨餓挨打，大家一律平等且各盡其能，強者會保護弱者，一如老少校演講那晚她拱起前腳保護沒了媽媽的小鴨子。她搞不懂為什麼會走到這一步，凶猛咆哮的大狗四處巡邏，大家不敢暢所欲言，且眼睜睜看著同志們在坦承不當罪行之後被撕咬成碎片。幸運草心裡沒有一絲抗爭或違逆的念頭，她知道現在的情形遠比瓊斯在時好很多，而且避免人類奪回農莊是最重要的事情。不管發生什麼，她都得要保持忠誠、努力工作、完成自己的使命、服從拿破崙的領導。然而，這真的不是她和其他動物日夜企盼、努力打拚所求的結果，他們建造風車、面對瓊斯的子彈為的並不是這個。這就是幸運草的想法，只是她無法以言語表達。

最後，幸運草想到了個方式，多少能表達無法言喻的心情—她唱起〈英格蘭之獸〉。坐在身旁的其他動物也跟著唱起來，他們一連唱了三次，雖然歌聲優美，卻十分緩慢、哀傷，這種唱法以前從沒聽過。

唱完第三遍時，尖叫者在兩條狗隨同下走過來，一副有要事相告的模樣，他宣布，依照拿破崙特別命令，〈英格蘭之獸〉已經廢止，今後不准再唱。

動物們大吃一驚。

「為什麼？」穆里兒嚷嚷道。

「同志，因為沒必要唱這首歌了，」尖叫者語氣強硬地說：「〈英格蘭之獸〉代表抗爭，現在抗爭成功了，今天下午處決叛徒是最後的行動。如今，內神外鬼皆已剷除。我們唱〈英格蘭之獸〉是期待將來有個美好社會，現在，我們已經建立起這樣的社會，這首歌顯然沒有再唱的必要了。」

大家都很害怕，有些動物或許有意表示反對，可是羊群又在大聲咩叫「四足善，雙足惡」，一叫叫了好幾分鐘，最後討論草草結束。

就這樣，農莊內再也聽不到〈英格蘭之獸〉，而作詩大師小指則寫了另一首歌代替，這首歌開頭是這樣唱的：

動物農莊，動物農莊，

吾等絕不將汝傷！

每個星期天升完旗後，全體就會合唱這首新歌。但在動物心裡，新歌的歌詞和旋律都比不上〈英格蘭之獸〉。

## 附录莫斯科大审判

大清洗让人公开认罪，出乎一般人的想象。

解密档案显示，莫斯科审判采用了严酷的非法刑讯和精神摧残，很多人是因为顾及妻儿的生命才认罪的。当然，还有托洛茨基那句话：“归根到底，党总是对的，因为党是无产阶级完成其根本任务的独一无二的历史工具”。

[像检察官一样控诉自己的罪犯](http://news.ifeng.com/history/4/200801/0115_338_366421.shtml)

莫斯科大审判是大清洗中最具代表性的场景，而莫斯科审判最令人瞠目的，是这种只有罪犯口供而无任何物证的审判，居然是公开进行的，而且邀请了西方记者、外交使团和独立观察人士前去旁听。  

西方人看到了只有社会主义苏联才会出现的不可思议场景：所有被告，没有一个人为自己辩护，他们一上庭就主动控诉自己的罪恶，把自己描述成不杀不足以平民愤的魔鬼，被告们一致要求枪毙自己，最后，他们都用最美好的词汇赞美斯大林同志。  

所有被告人的陈述与检察长的起诉内容一模一样。  

当然，莫斯科审判还不够完美，出现了本可避免小错误：  

被告戈尔茨曼供认，他于1932年11月在哥本哈根对“布利斯托里”饭店与托洛茨基的儿子接头，但丹麦报纸声明，该饭店1917年就被拆除……

[美国人无法破解的药剂](http://news.ifeng.com/history/4/200801/0115_338_366423.shtml)

赫鲁晓夫在秘密报告中重述了那个著名笑话：斯大林的烟斗丢了，贝利亚第二天就抓到了10个小偷，他们全都招供了，而斯大林则在自己的沙发下找到了那个烟斗。  

早在1920年代，同志们就强烈批评 “契卡”（KGB前身）工作人员的“异化”：他们已经完全和我们常人不同，他们冰冷无情，好像只对一件事有乐趣，就是欣赏他人被折磨的痛苦……他们身上已经看不到一点布尔什维克的痕迹。  

他们已摸索出一套向犯人要口供的经验，毒打虽是种最简单原始的手段，但要人痛苦得生不如死，离目标就不远了。对犯人精力、精神的无情践踏和摧毁，令犯人自尊、信心丧失殆尽，便可如愿。譬如乌克兰中央委员会书记柯秀尔很能扛打，但当面强奸他16岁的女儿，他就老实了。

[为了党的利益](http://news.ifeng.com/history/4/200801/0115_338_366426.shtml)

为什么这么多被冤屈的共产党人会配合审判者在法庭上承认自己有罪？毫无疑问，秘密警察很残暴，但要他们在法庭上像排演话剧一样争先要求严惩自己，刑讯并不能完全做到这点。  

也许莫洛托夫对季诺维也夫的话是另外一种不可或缺的工具：  

“您向党撒过多少次谎？您的谎言给党造成了多少次伤害？现在，为了党的利益，建议您诽谤自己。目前，在托洛茨基分裂工人运动和德国人准备进攻我们的时候，您的谎言无疑能够帮助党。这一点不容拒绝。要讨论什么呢？如果党的利益要求这样做，我们不仅应该献出我们微不足道的名誉，还应该献出生命。不过，客观上并没有要求您撒任何的谎……”

弗拉基米尔·列宁于1924年去世，随后苏联共产党内逐步形成了权力真空。列宁政府中任职的不少人想要继承他的政治遗产。苏共总书记约瑟夫·斯大林在争夺政治遗产的斗争中获胜，并最终于1928年完全掌控了苏共。最开始，斯大林的领导地位被广泛接受，一国社会主义也成为了当时党内被铭记的政治政策。但是，自1930年代早期起，受集体化造成的灾难及第一个五年计划有限成果的影响，党内官员对斯大林领导地位的认同逐渐动摇，包括托洛茨基在内的斯大林的政治对手也不断试图削弱斯大林对党的控制力。

1934年,时任列宁格勒州委书记谢尔盖·基洛夫遇刺。苏联内务部门对基洛夫的死进行了一场大规模的调查，最终找出了一个反对斯大林的党内政治网络，其中包括斯大林的几个政治对手。基洛夫遇刺案中被捕的许多人供认了他们有杀害斯大林本人的计划。

1938年3月，斯大林宣布内部敌人已被清除，大清洗基本结束。之后，斯大林批评内务人民委员部进行大规模处决，并于随后下令处决了在大清洗年代领导该机构的亨里希·雅戈达和尼古拉·叶若夫。尽管大清洗已经结束，但不信任的气氛和对党内广泛的监视在之后的几十年里仍未消除。

### 导言

《内务人民委员部第447号命令》的摘抄

在苏联，“镇压”一词被苏共总书记约瑟夫·斯大林用来表示对被认为是反革命分子或者阶级敌人的人的迫害。史学家们常常会争论大清洗发生的根本原因，具体论述包括斯大林的偏执、斯大林想要清除异己或斯大林想巩固自己的权威。清洗始于苏联红军内部，随后蔓延至社会的各个方面。当时大多数的公众注意力聚焦在对党政军高级干部的清洗上，不过知识分子、农民（尤其是富农）和技术专家同样是清洗的目标。

少数族裔同样是内务人民委员部的行动目标，他们被指控为受“第五纵队”控制。波兰裔的普通苏联公民是其中的受害者之一，苏联官方给出的解释是这些清洗行动是为消除波兰军事组织进行破坏和其他秘密活动的可能性。

苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫1956年的秘密报告《关于个人崇拜及其后果》以及史学家罗伯特·康奎斯特的研究都指出，许多此类的指责，包括在莫斯科审判中提供的证据，是由刑讯逼供乃至酷刑得到的，或者是从俄罗斯苏维埃加盟共和国的刑法第58条（反革命罪行）的过分扩展的理解的基础上得出的。这些审判也并非按照当时苏联法律条文执行，因为当时的合法法庭在这些审判中全部被秘密警察的三人法庭代替。

数十万人死于大清洗，逾十万人被枪毙，上百万人被迫迁居。许多人被关押、拷打或者送入劳改营和古拉格。由于饥饿、疾病、恶劣的环境条件和沉重的劳动，许多人死在劳改营中。大清洗是在亨里希·雅戈达任内务人民委员时开始的，但是其顶峰则在1936年9月到1938年8月之间，当时的秘密警察首脑是尼古拉·叶若夫，这段时间有时也被称为“叶若夫时期”。但是整个大清洗是以苏共中央总书记斯大林为首的苏联共产党中央政治局领导的，有些命令甚至直接由政治局发布。

比如1937年政治局发布命令对被告人施加“身体压力”，这个命令在实践中被理解为拷打和非法谋杀。大清洗结束时叶若夫被解除职务，以间谍罪（后来被证明是错误的）和叛变罪行而受审、被判枪决。

### 背景

参见：苏联共产党对党内的清洗

自1930年起，党和警察官员一直担心强制农民集体化所造成的社会动荡，由此产生的1932–1933年的大饥荒，以及数百万农民不受控制地大规模迁移到城市将造成“社会混乱”。而欧洲的战事让苏联人感受到了威胁，并进一步加剧了斯大林和一般苏联人对社会和政治上的可疑人士的不良看法，并认为他们会在入侵时起事资敌。纳粹德国在这一时期散布的指控无辜苏联公民的伪造文件和假消息进一步助长了这种猜疑。斯大林开始计划预防性地消灭这些人，并认为他们是“破坏者、恐怖分子、间谍和第五纵队”。

起初，“清洗”一词在苏联政治用语中意为被清除出党，如1933年约40万人被开除党籍的情况。但是在1936年到1953年间，该名词的意义有所变化，因为在这段时间里，开除党籍几乎一定意味着被捕、关押，乃至处决。

苏共中央总书记斯大林和苏共中央政治局希望消灭任何反对政府的专制统治的源泉。他们希望保证党员会按照“民主集中制”无疑地执行以斯大林为中心的中央的命令，不希望苏联共产党是一个像第一次世界大战前那样的多元的革命党派（实际上在1920年代苏联共产党已经失去了它的多元性）。另一个官方的理由是消灭任何战争时期可能会出现的“第五纵队”，但是不进行中立研究无法证明当时的确有这个危险。第五纵队的理论是莫洛托夫提出的，他本人是斯大林权力中心中的人物之一，而且亲手签署了多个枪决命令。此外共产党还想借此消灭“危害社会的分子”、富农、过去的反对党成员（比如社会革命党的党员）以及过去的沙皇军官。

十月革命后苏联共产党就始终使用一系列手段来镇压它认为对自己有威胁的人，比如施行恐怖，或者施加社会监视，有时这些镇压比较不明显，有时则会达到一个顶峰，比如在红色恐怖期间，或者对反对集体化的富农进行的镇压等等。大清洗与这些镇压不同的地方在于共产党首次对自己内部进行大规模的镇压。但是实际上总的来说共产党员和官员占被害者总数的小部分。党内清洗与对整个社会的清洗是同时进行的。总的来说整个大清洗过程可以分以下三个阶段：

第一次莫斯科审判（1936年）

引入秘密警察三人审判团来加速“革命正义”（1937年）

引入刑法第58条第14款（反革命破坏）（1937年）

### 莫斯科审判

主条目：莫斯科审判

负责进行大规模镇压的内务人民委员部领导，从左到右依次为雅科夫·阿格拉诺夫、亨里希·雅戈达、未知人士、斯坦尼斯拉夫·弗兰特斯维奇·雷登斯，上述三人（除未知人士）同样随后在大清洗中被处死。

1934年12月1日，列宁格勒州委书记谢尔盖·基洛夫在自己的办公室中被一个名叫列昂尼德·瓦西里耶维奇·尼古拉耶夫的失业者开枪打死。斯大林对此大做文章，从1936年到1938年在莫斯科进行了对部分原共产党高级领导人的三次公审。被告人被控与西方列强阴谋刺杀斯大林和其他苏联领导人、解体苏联以及建立资本主义社会。全苏联的宣传机器都被动员起来，人民群众经教育后得知，那些失势的前反对派们是如此险恶，他们谋杀了基洛夫，还想谋杀总书记斯大林，甚至全体政治局委员。

第一次莫斯科审判是1936年8月针对所谓的“托洛茨基-季诺维耶夫恐怖中心”的16名被告人的审判，其中格里戈里·季诺维也夫和列夫·加米涅夫是重要的前党领导。所有16人被判死刑。

第二次莫斯科审判是1937年1月，被告17人中包括卡尔·拉狄克等。13人被判处死刑，其余被关入劳改营，这些人很快死于营中。

第三次莫斯科审判是1938年3月针对所谓的“托洛茨基和右派集团”，其中包括原共产国际主席尼古拉·布哈林、原总理阿列克谢·李可夫、克里斯蒂安·拉科夫斯基和原秘密警察首领雅戈达本人。所有重要被告人均被判死刑。

此外于1937年6月还在一个军事法庭上对一批苏联红军将军进行了一次秘密审判，被告人中包括米哈伊尔·图哈切夫斯基。

一些出席公审的西方观察员说公审是公正的，被告的罪责确凿。他们的这个判断基于被告人在法庭上，在显然没有受到任何拷打或药物影响的状态下，所做的供认。

比如一位英国律师写道：“这些虚心的社会主义者又一次被怀疑和愤怒围困”，但是“在战场的烟雾滚过之后我们又一次坚定地认识到控告是正确的、承认是正确的，判决是公正的。”

现在有证据显示被告人的认罪是在对他们施加了极大的心理压力后才获得的。通过前秘密警察军官亚历山大·奥尔洛夫和其他人的叙述，得知认罪的手段：反复殴打、拷打、让被告人连续数日站立、不准睡觉、威胁关押和杀害被告人的家庭成员。比如加米涅夫的青年儿子被捕并被控恐怖主义。使用这样的手段数月后被告人陷入绝望和精力耗竭。

季诺维耶夫和加米涅夫提出“认罪”的条件是政治局保证他们和他们的亲人不被枪决。但是他们并没有获得政治局的保证，相反地他们与斯大林、伏罗希洛夫和耶卓夫单独会晤。会上斯大林给予他们这个保证。但是事后斯大林不但没有饶恕被告，而且将他们大多数亲人逮捕甚至处以死刑。布哈林也同意以家属不受害为“认罪”条件，这个条件得到部分实现：他的妻子被关入劳改营，但是幸存。

1937年5月在美国，托洛茨基的支持者成立了一个“考察在莫斯科审判中针对托洛茨基的控告的委员会”，一般被称为杜威委员会，来考察公审中被“证实的事实”。这个委员会的主席是美国哲学家和教育家约翰·杜威。虽然这个委员会明显地要证明托洛茨基的无罪，但是它还是揭露了莫斯科审判中所“证实”的一些事件不可能是真的。

比如一位被告承认说他于1935年12月飞往奥斯陆从托洛茨基“获得进行恐怖活动的命令”。但是杜威委员会证明没有这次飞行。另一位被告承认说他于1934年12月参加了一场谋杀，但是此时他已经被关押了一年了。

杜威委员会在其422页厚的书《无罪》中发表了它的研究结果。它的结论是所有莫斯科审判中被判的人全部无罪。它总结说：“与外来迹象无关，委员会发现：

莫斯科审判在其施行中就是为了要使得不了解真相的民众相信它确证了事实。

虽然一般认罪是最有力的证据，但是当事人承认了如此不可能的罪行，以至于委员会确信不论这些认罪是如何获得的，它们不是事实。

托洛茨基从未指导任何在莫斯科审判中被告的人与外国势力一起反对苏联，以及托洛茨基从未要求、计划或试图在苏联设立资本主义。”

委员会总结说：“我们因此认为莫斯科审判是在做秀。”

当时一些相信莫斯科审判是公正的人引用莫洛托夫的说法来解释为什么有些认罪包含不可能的事实。比如这些打算挖苏联及其政府的墙脚的人承认可怀疑的事件来让人怀疑他们的审判的正确性。但是莫洛托夫本人就是政治局成员，他自己签署了死刑执行命令，因此他的解释本身就很可疑。

### 军队内的肃清

主条目：图哈切夫斯基案件

最早晋升的五位苏联元帅，前排由左至右为米哈伊尔·图哈切夫斯基、克利缅特·伏罗希洛夫、亚历山大·叶戈罗夫，后排从左到右为谢苗·布琼尼、瓦西里·布柳赫尔；只有布琼尼和伏罗希洛夫活过了大清洗。

红军内的清洗是由通过捷克斯洛伐克总统爱德华·贝奈斯传递的纳粹假造的文件（盖世太保首长莱因哈德·海德里希伪造的）引起的。这些伪造的文件包括红军元帅图哈切夫斯基与德国最高指挥部成员的通信。红军中5位元帅中的3位、15位集团军司令中的13位、9位海军上将中的8位、57位军长中的50位、186位师长中的154位、全部16位陆军政治委员、28位军政治委员中的25位在清洗中被处以死刑。

### 更广泛的肃清

最后几乎所有在1917年俄国革命和在列宁政府中起过重要角色的苏联共产党领导人都被消灭。在1917年十月革命时期中的六位政治局成员中，除斯大林本人外，另外五位中四人被处死，列夫·托洛茨基被开除党籍后四处流亡，于1940年在墨西哥被苏联间谍谋杀。从十月革命到1924年列宁逝世期间被选入政治局的七人中四人被处死，米哈伊尔·汤姆斯基自杀，两人（莫洛托夫和加里宁）幸存。从1934年参加第17届共产党代表大会的1966名代表中1108人被捕，这些人几乎全部死于狱中。

当时对前党领导人的审判和处死只不过是大清洗的一小部分。

参见：被处决的文艺复兴

苏联诗人奥西普·曼德尔施塔姆于1938年被内务部逮捕时的收监照，他随后于同年死于劳改营中
在1920年代和1930年代，2000名作家、知识分子和艺术家被监禁，其中1500人在监狱和集中营中丧生。太阳黑子发展研究被判定为非马克思主义后，27名天文学家于1936年至1938年间失踪。早在1933年，气象局就因未能预测到对农作物有害的天气而遭到暴力清洗。然而，作家的伤亡人数尤其高，大量苏联作家遭到残酷迫害和清洗，这段历史时期被乌克兰学者称为“被处决的文艺复兴”。

原富农

虽然富农“作为阶级已经被消灭”，但是1937年7月30日秘密警察发布了第00447号针对“原富农”、“富农帮凶”和其它反苏联分子的命令。这个命令后来成为一系列其它秘密警察针对其它人群的命令的原型。

秘密警察针对少数民族的行动

从1937年到1940年，出于对战争时期所谓的“最可能的敌人”以及周围的想要瓦解苏联国家的“敌对资本主义国家”的“第五纵队”的恐惧，秘密警察发动了一系列针对个别少数民族人的大规模行动。最早的是针对波兰人的行动。许多这些行动是按照一个数量来完成的，上级军官按照一定的统计数据下令当地的秘密警察关押和处决一定数量的“反革命分子”。少数民族干部被指资产阶级民族主义分子。

命运最为悲惨的当属北高加索人，集体化期间，印古什、车臣热爱骑马的北高加索人不愿被剥夺养马的权利，于是反抗者被当作富农遭清洗，大清洗期间，被苏联政权视为“问题民族”的车臣人再次遭到镇压，其结果直接导致后来德国入侵时车臣人几乎全体倒戈协助德军。

西方移民受害者

大清洗的受害者包括了移民到苏联的美国人，他们在大萧条最严重的时期移民到苏联寻找工作。在大清洗最严重的时候，美国移民围攻美国大使馆，乞求得到美国护照，这样他们就可以离开苏联。然而，他们被美国大使馆的官员拒之门外，却在潜伏在外面的人行道上的内务人民委员部特工逮捕。不少人随后在布托沃射击场被枪杀。此外，141名芬兰裔美国共产主义者在桑达尔莫赫被处决并埋葬。127名芬兰裔加拿大人也被枪杀并埋在那里。

古拉格囚犯的处决

关押在古拉格的政治犯也被大量处决。内务人民委员部第00447号命令还将“集中营中最恶毒、最顽固的反苏分子”都“归入第一类”，即枪决。内务人民委员部第00447号命令下令对这支队伍处决 10000人，但在秘密大规模行动过程中被枪杀的人数至少增加了三倍，其中大多数发生在1938年3月至4月。

蒙古的大清洗

主条目：大镇压

1930年代后期，斯大林向蒙古人民共和国派遣了内务人民委员部特工，建立了蒙古版的三人法庭，处决了数以万计被指控与“亲日间谍团伙”有联系的人。佛教喇嘛占受害者的大多数，有 18,000人在大清洗中丧生。其他受害者是贵族、政治和学术人物，以及一些普通工人和牧民。最近在2003年发现了包含数百名被处决的佛教僧侣和平民的万人坑。

新疆的大清洗

主条目：1937年新疆战争和盛世才

中华民国新疆省的亲苏领导人盛世才于1937年发起了自己的清洗，以配合斯大林的大清洗。其间爆发新疆战争。盛世才得到了内务人民委员部的援助。盛世才和苏联人指控托洛茨基主义者的大规模阴谋和摧毁苏联的“法西斯托派的阴谋”。苏联总领事加列金·阿普列索夫、马虎山、马绍武、Mahmud Sijan、新疆省官方领导人Huang Han-chang和和加尼牙孜等435人被指控参与阴谋。新疆实际上处于苏联的控制之下。

### 结束

1938年夏，斯大林和他的周围意识到大清洗过头了。叶若夫被解除秘密警察首领职务（一开始依然是水上运输委员长），并以自己被清洗掉而告终。斯大林的同乡和新任者拉夫连季·帕夫洛维奇·贝利亚继任秘密警察首脑。1938年11月17日苏联人民委员会和苏联共产党中央委员会共同发表了《关于关押、检举审问和拷问的法令》，此后贝利亚领导的秘密警察发布的命令取消了大多数秘密警察大规模活动，放弃了死刑的应用。这是这场大清洗的结束。

在斯大林逝世前仍有大规模关押和流放的事件，而大清洗期间关押大批政治犯的古拉格系统直到1960年才被苏联内务部关闭。

### 西方的反应

虽然对前苏联领导人的审判原则上是公开的，但是事实上被关押和死刑不是公开的。只有在后来少数被关押在古拉格的幸存者逃到西方后人们才渐渐认识到这些事实。但是西方记者不但没有能够报道这场大清洗，而且在许多西方国家中，尤其在法国，有人甚至企图置这些当事人的叙述于不可信。比如让-保罗·萨特认为应该忽视这些集中营的事实来使得法国无产阶级不被灰心。但是一系列合法的研究还是证明这些当事人所报道的事件是真实的。

1968年前共产党员、英国间谍和英国外交部信息研究局（其作用是反共宣传）的撰稿人罗伯特·康奎斯特发表了他的书《大恐怖》。康奎斯特认为许多西方观察家没有能够洞察整个公审中的作弊。他还阐明虽然当时大多数国家的共产党尊随苏联共产党的方针，但是一些国家的共产党组织，尤其是左翼的组织，在这场运动中是最持批评性观点的。

虽然西方对公审主要持悲观态度，虽然偶尔有对古拉格的报道，但是大多数西方知识分子依然持亲苏态度。直到1956年斯大林的罪行已经在苏联共产党内部公开后一些这些人只是退出了共产党，但依然坚持共产主义。随着冷战和麦卡锡主义的开始在西方共产党人被迫害，一些人出于保护自己的目的脱离共产党。而且斯大林死后整个大清洗的现实和它的规模开始渐渐暴露。美国共产党的机关报纸全幅刊登了赫鲁晓夫的秘密报告。1973年亚历山大·索尔仁尼琴发表了《古拉格群岛》。1980年代戈尔巴乔夫公开批判斯大林的罪行。苏联解体后苏联的文献得以被西方和俄罗斯学者研究。最后在始终比较亲苏的法国发表了《共产主义黑皮书》，将共产主义与纳粹主义相比。虽然如此至今为止一直有人试图减少大清洗所带来的浩劫。

### 平反与纪念

1953年斯大林死后，赫鲁晓夫上台，并开始揭露大清洗的真相。但是赫鲁晓夫的平反之路非常艰难，1964年赫鲁晓夫的下台很快使平反工作处于半停滞状态。大规模和全面平反直到1985年戈尔巴乔夫上台后才得以展开。

1956年2月在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上赫鲁晓夫做了著名的《关于个人崇拜及其后果》秘密报告（一个月后这个报告被发表）。赫鲁晓夫称大清洗是斯大林“滥用权力”，为国家带来了巨大的破坏。在同一报告中赫鲁晓夫承认许多受害者是无辜的，他们的认罪基于受拷打后获得的假认罪。

早在1954年开始一些被害者已经被平反。被判有罪的红军将军于1957年被平反。在1950年代其他许多的被害者和一些前政治局成员被平反。但是在莫斯科审判中被判的布哈林等人直到1988年才被平反。同年，苏联所有中小学生的历史期末考试取消，决定称：“那些用谎言毒害人民的思想和心灵，欺骗了一代又一代的人，其罪行是巨大的，罄竹难书。”俄罗斯时代，前苏联众多秘密文件和档案解密，大清洗运动中诸多不为人知和早先引起争议的细节得以澄清。

## 附录电视认罪新时尚

电视认罪相比苏联的大清洗有人性多了！

电视认罪（英语：Televised confession或TV confession），另称电视悔罪，是指在侦查阶段让当事人在电视上承认自己罪行的行为，也就是发生于被逮捕后的羁押期间、法院定罪宣判之前。

在中国大陆广泛播出的电视认罪第一例是2013年9月的网络大V薛蛮子嫖娼案。据德国之声引述“保护卫士”的统计，截至2018年2月，中国共有45宗在电视上播出认罪视频的案例，半数以上为“人权案例”。这些案例中的被捕人士在电视认罪时均没有被定罪。“保护卫士”表示，2013年至2016年，大约每月有一个电视认罪视频出现。

2014年中共十八届四中全会提出“推进以审判为中心的诉讼制度改革”的要求。2016年3月中国两会期间，时任政协委员兼全国律师协会副会长朱征夫曾于政协会议提案呼吁减少乃至取消电视认罪。

2017年2月中华人民共和国最高人民法院印发《关于全面推进以审判为中心的刑事诉讼制度改革的实施意见》，提出“坚持非法证据排除原则，不得强迫任何人证实自己有罪”。据德国之声2018年6月的报道，到2017年电视认罪数量大幅减少，当年只统计到2起电视认罪案例。电视认罪案例数量减少的同时，法庭认罪视频则明显增加。

其他国家

在伊朗，据国际人权联盟及“Justice for Iran”的研究报告显示，在2010年到2020年的十年中，至少出现了355起在电视上强迫认罪的案例。据保护卫士的调查，自2007年以来，越南至少有21例强迫电视认罪。

## Chapter 8

A FEW DAYS LATER, when the terror caused by the executions had died down, some of the animals remembered—or thought they remembered—that the Sixth Commandment decreed "No animal shall kill any other animal." And though no one cared to mention it in the hearing of the pigs or the dogs, it was felt that the killings which had taken place did not square with this. Clover asked Benjamin to read her the Sixth Commandment, and when Benjamin, as usual, said that he refused to meddle in such matters, she fetched Muriel. Muriel read the Commandment for her. It ran: "No animal shall kill any other animal without cause." Somehow or other, the last two words had slipped out of the animals' memory. But they saw now that the Commandment had not been violated; for clearly there was good reason for killing the traitors who had leagued themselves with Snowball.

Throughout the year the animals worked even harder than they had worked in the previous year. To rebuild the windmill, with walls twice as thick as before, and to finish it by the appointed date, together with the regular work of the farm, was a tremendous labour. There were times when it seemed to the animals that they worked longer hours and fed no better than they had done in Jones's day. On Sunday mornings Squealer, holding down a long strip of paper with his trotter, would read out to them lists of figures proving that the production of every class of foodstuff had increased by two hundred percent, three hundred percent, or five hundred percent, as the case might be. The animals saw no reason to disbelieve him, especially as they could no longer remember very clearly what conditions had been like before the Rebellion. All the same, there were days when they felt that they would sooner have had less figures and more food.

**All orders were now issued through Squealer or one of the other pigs. Napoleon himself was not seen in public as often as once in a fortnight. When he did appear, he was attended not only by his retinue of dogs but by a black cockerel who marched in front of him and acted as a kind of trumpeter, letting out a loud "cock-a-doodle-doo" before Napoleon spoke. Even in the farmhouse, it was said, Napoleon inhabited separate apartments from the others. He took his meals alone, with two dogs to wait upon him, and always ate from the Crown Derby dinner service which had been in the glass cupboard in the drawing-room. It was also announced that the gun would be fired every year on Napoleon's birthday, as well as on the other two anniversaries.**

Napoleon was now never spoken of simply as "Napoleon." He was always referred to in formal style as "our Leader, Comrade Napoleon," and the pigs liked to invent for him such titles as Father of All Animals, Terror of Mankind, Protector of the Sheepfold, Ducklings' Friend, and the like. In his speeches, Squealer would talk with the tears rolling down his cheeks of Napoleon's wisdom, the goodness of his heart, and the deep love he bore to all animals everywhere, even and especially the unhappy animals who still lived in ignorance and slavery on other farms. It had become usual to give Napoleon the credit for every successful achievement and every stroke of good fortune. You would often hear one hen remark to another, "Under the guidance of our Leader, Comrade Napoleon, I have laid five eggs in six days"; or two cows, enjoying a drink at the pool, would exclaim, "Thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon, how excellent this water tastes!" The general feeling on the farm was well expressed in a poem entitled "Comrade Napoleon," which was composed by Minimus and which ran as follows:

Friend of fatherless!

Fountain of happiness!

Lord of the swill-bucket! Oh, how my soul is on

Fire when Igaze at thy

Calm and commanding eye,

Like the sun in the sky,

Comrade Napoleon!

Thou art the giver of

All that thy creatures love,

Full belly twice a day, clean straw to roll upon;

Every beast great or small

Sleeps at peace in his stall,

Thou watchest over all,

Comrade Napoleon!

Had I a sucking-pig,

Ere he had grown as big

Even as a pint bottle or as a rolling-pin,

He should have learned to be

Faithful and true to thee,

Yes, his first squeak should be

"Comrade Napoleon!"



Napoleon approved of this poem and caused it to be inscribed on the wall of the big barn, at the opposite end from the Seven Commandments. It was surmounted by a portrait of Napoleon, in profile, executed by Squealer in white paint.

Meanwhile, through the agency of Whymper, Napoleon was engaged in complicated negotiations with Frederick and Pilkington. The pile of timber was still unsold. Of the two, Frederick was the more anxious to get hold of it, but he would not offer a reasonable price. At the same time there were renewed rumours that Frederick and his men were plotting to attack Animal Farm and to destroy the windmill, the building of which had aroused furious jealousy in him. Snowball was known to be still skulking on Pinchfield Farm. In the middle of the summer the animals were alarmed to hear that three hens had come forward and confessed that, inspired by Snowball, they had entered into a plot to murder Napoleon. They were executed immediately, and fresh precautions for Napoleon's safety were taken. Four dogs guarded his bed at night, one at each corner, and a young pig named Pinkeye was given the task of tasting all his food before he ate it, lest it should be poisoned.

At about the same time it was given out that Napoleon had arranged to sell the pile of timber to Mr. Pilkington; he was also going to enter into a regular agreement for the exchange of certain products between Animal Farm and Foxwood. The relations between Napoleon and Pilkington, though they were only conducted through Whymper, were now almost friendly. The animals distrusted Pilkington, as a human being, but greatly preferred him to Frederick, whom they both feared and hated. As the summer wore on, and the windmill neared completion, the rumours of an impending treacherous attack grew stronger and stronger. Frederick, it was said, intended to bring against them twenty men all armed with guns, and he had already bribed the magistrates and police, so that if he could once get hold of the title-deeds of Animal Farm they would ask no questions. **Moreover, terrible stories were leaking out from Pinchfield about the cruelties that Frederick practised upon his animals. He had flogged an old horse to death, he starved his cows, he had killed a dog by throwing it into the furnace, he amused himself in the evenings by making cocks fight with splinters of razor-blade ded to their spurs. The animals' blood boiled with rage when they heard of these things being done to their comrades, and sometimes they clamoured to be allowed to go out in a body and attack Pinchfield Farm, drive out the humans, and set the animals free. But Squealer counselled them to avoid rash actions and trust in Comrade Napoleon's strategy.**

Nevertheless, feeling against Frederick continued to run high. One Sunday morning Napoleon appeared in the barn and explained that he had never at any time contemplated selling the pile of timber to Frederick; he considered it beneath his dignity, he said, to have dealings with scoundrels of that description. The pigeons who were still sent out to spread tidings of the Rebellion were forbidden to set foot anywhere on Foxwood, and were also ordered to drop their former slogan of "Death to Humanity" in favour of "Death to Frederick." In the late summer yet another of Snowball's machinations was laid bare. The wheat crop was full of weeds, and it was discovered that on one of his nocturnal visits Snowball had mixed weed seeds with the seed corn. A gander who had been privy to the plot had confessed his guilt to Squealer and immediately committed suicide by swallowing deadly nightshade berries. The animals now also learned that Snowball had never—as many of them had believed hitherto—received the order of "Animal Hero, First Class." This was merely a legend which had been spread some time after the Battle of the Cowshed by Snowball himself. So far from being decorated, he had been censured for showing cowardice in the battle. Once again some of the animals heard this with a certain bewilderment, but Squealer was soon able to convince them that their memories had been at fault.

In the autumn, by a tremendous, exhausting effort—for the harvest had to be gathered at almost the same time—the windmill was finished. The machinery had still to be installed, and Whymper was negotiating the purchase of it, but the structure was completed. In the teeth of every difficulty, in spite of inexperience, of primitive implements, of bad luck and of Snowball's treachery, the work had been finished punctually to the very day! Tired out but proud, the animals walked round and round their masterpiece, which appeared even more beautiful in their eyes than when it had been built the first time. Moreover, the walls were twice as thick as before. Nothing short of explosives would lay them low this time! And when they thought of how they had laboured, what discouragements they had overcome, and the enormous difference that would be made in their lives when the sails were turning and the dynamos running—when they thought of all this, their tiredness forsook them and they gambolled round and round the windmill, uttering cries of triumph. Napoleon himself, attended by his dogs and his cockerel, came down to inspect the completed work; he personally congratulated the animals on their achievement, and announced that the mill would be named Napoleon Mill.

Two days later the animals were called together for a special meeting in the barn. They were struck dumb with surprise when Napoleon announced that he had sold the pile of timber to Frederick. Tomorrow Frederick's wagons would arrive and begin carting it away. Throughout the whole period of his seeming friendship with Pilkington, Napoleon had really been in secret agreement with Frederick.

All relations with Foxwood had been broken off; insulting messages had been sent to Pilkington. The pigeons had been told to avoid Pinchfield Farm and to alter their slogan from "Death to Frederick" to "Death to Pilkington." At the same time Napoleon assured the animals that the stories of an impending attack on Animal Farm were completely untrue, and that the tales about Frederick's cruelty to his own animals had been greatly exaggerated. All these rumours had probably originated with Snowball and his agents. It now appeared that Snowball was not, after all, hiding on Pinchfield Farm, and in fact had never been there in his life: he was living—in considerable luxury, so it was said—at Foxwood, and had in reality been a pensioner of Pilkington for years past.

The pigs were in ecstasies over Napoleon's cunning. By seeming to be friendly with Pilkington he had forced Frederick to raise his price by twelve pounds. But the superior quality of Napoleon's mind, said Squealer, was shown in the fact that he trusted nobody, not even Frederick. Frederick had wanted to pay for the timber with something called a cheque, which, it seemed, was a piece of paper with a promise to pay written upon it. But Napoleon was too clever for him. He had demanded payment in real five-pound notes, which were to be handed over before the timber was removed. Already Frederick had paid up; and the sum he had paid was just enough to buy the machinery for the windmill.

Meanwhile the timber was being carted away at high speed. When it was all gone, another special meeting was held in the barn for the animals to inspect Frederick's bank-notes. Smiling beatifically, and wearing both his decorations, Napoleon reposed on a bed of straw on the platform, with the money at his side, neatly piled on a china dish from the farmhouse kitchen. The animals filed slowly past, and each gazed his fill. And Boxer put out his nose to sniff at the banknotes, and the flimsy white things stirred and rustled in his breath.

Three days later there was a terrible hullabaloo. Whymper, his face deadly pale, came racing up the path on his bicycle, flung it down in the yard and rushed straight into the farmhouse. The next moment a choking roar of rage sounded from Napoleon's apartments. The news of what had happened sped round the farm like wildfire. The banknotes were forgeries! Frederick had got the timber for nothing!

Napoleon called the animals together immediately and in a terrible voice pronounced the death sentence upon Frederick. When captured, he said, Frederick should be boiled alive. At the same time he warned them that after this treacherous deed the worst was to be expected. Frederick and his men might make their long-expected attack at any moment. Sentinels were placed at all the approaches to the farm. In addition, four pigeons were sent to Foxwood with a conciliatory message, which it was hoped might re-establish good relations with Pilkington.

The very next morning the attack came. The animals were at breakfast when the look-outs came racing in with the news that Frederick and his followers had already come through the five-barred gate. Boldly enough the animals sallied forth to meet them, but this time they did not have the easy victory that they had had in the Battle of the Cowshed. There were fifteen men, with half a dozen guns between them, and they opened fire as soon as they got within fifty yards. The animals could not face the terrible explosions and the stinging pellets, and in spite of the efforts of Napoleon and Boxer to rally them, they were soon driven back. A number of them were already wounded. They took refuge in the farm buildings and peeped cautiously out from chinks and knotholes. The whole of the big pasture, including the windmill, was in the hands of the enemy. For the moment even Napoleon seemed at a loss. He paced up and down without a word, his tail rigid and twitching. Wistful glances were sent in the direction of Foxwood. If Pilkington and his men would help them, the day might yet be won. But at this moment the four pigeons, who had been sent out on the day before, returned, one of them bearing a scrap of paper from Pilkington. On it was pencilled the words: "Serves you right."

Meanwhile Frederick and his men had halted about the windmill. The animals watched them, and a murmur of dismay went round. Two of the men had produced a crowbar and a sledge hammer. They were going to knock the windmill down.

"Impossible!" cried Napoleon. "We have built the walls far too thick for that. They could not knock it down in a week. Courage, comrades!"

But Benjamin was watching the movements of the men intently. The two with the hammer and the crowbar were drilling a hole near the base of the windmill. Slowly, and with an air almost of amusement, Benjamin nodded his long muzzle.

"I thought so," he said. "Do you not see what they are doing? In another moment they are going to pack blasting powder into that hole."

Terrified, the animals waited. It was impossible now to venture out of the shelter of the buildings. After a few minutes the men were seen to be running in all directions. Then there was a deafening roar. The pigeons swirled into the air, and all the animals, except Napoleon, flung themselves flat on their bellies and hid their faces. When they got up again, a huge cloud of black smoke was hanging where the windmill had been. Slowly the breeze drifted it away. The windmill had ceased to exist!

At this sight the animals' courage returned to them. The fear and despair they had felt a moment earlier were drowned in their rage against this vile, contemptible act. A mighty cry for vengeance went up, and without waiting for further orders they charged forth in a body and made straight for the enemy. This time they did not heed the cruel pellets that swept over them like hail. It was a savage, bitter battle. The men fired again and again, and, when the animals got to close quarters, lashed out with their sticks and their heavy boots. A cow, three sheep, and two geese were killed, and nearly everyone was wounded. Even Napoleon, who was directing operations from the rear, had the tip of his tail chipped by a pellet. But the men did not go unscathed either. Three of them had their heads broken by blows from Boxer's hoofs; another was gored in the belly by a cow's horn; another had his trousers nearly torn off by Jessie and Bluebell. And when the nine dogs of Napoleon's own bodyguard, whom he had instructed to make a detour under cover of the hedge, suddenly appeared on the men's flank, baying ferociously, panic overtook them. They saw that they were in danger of being surrounded. Frederick shouted to his men to get out while the going was good, and the next moment the cowardly enemy was running for dear life. The animals chased them right down to the bottom of the field, and got in some last kicks at them as they forced their way through the thorn hedge.

They had won, but they were weary and bleeding. Slowly they began to limp back towards the farm. The sight of their dead comrades stretched upon the grass moved some of them to tears. And for a little while they halted in sorrowful silence at the place where the windmill had once stood. Yes, it was gone; almost the last trace of their labour was gone! Even the foundations were partially destroyed. And in rebuilding it they could not this time, as before, make use of the fallen stones. This time the stones had vanished too. The force of the explosion had flung them to distances of hundreds of yards. It was as though the windmill had never been.

As they approached the farm Squealer, who had unaccountably been absent during the fighting, came skipping towards them, whisking his tail and beaming with satisfaction. And the animals heard, from the direction of the farm buildings, the solemn booming of a gun.

"What is that gun firing for?" said Boxer.

"To celebrate our victory!" cried Squealer.

"What victory?" said Boxer. His knees were bleeding, he had lost a shoe and split his hoof, and a dozen pellets had lodged themselves in his hind leg.

"What victory, comrade? Have we not driven the enemy off our soil—the sacred soil of Animal Farm?"

"But they have destroyed the windmill. And we had worked on it for two years!"

"What matter? We will build another windmill. We will build six windmills if we feel like it. You do not appreciate, comrade, the mighty thing that we have done. The enemy was in occupation of this very ground that we stand upon. And now—thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon—we have won every inch of it back again!"

"Then we have won back what we had before," said Boxer.

"That is our victory," said Squealer.

They limped into the yard. The pellets under the skin of Boxer's leg smarted painfully. He saw ahead of him the heavy labour of rebuilding the windmill from the foundations, and already in imagination he braced himself for the task. But for the first time it occurred to him that he was eleven years old and that perhaps his great muscles were not quite what they had once been.

But when the animals saw the green flag flying, and heard the gun firing again—seven times it was fired in all—and heard the speech that Napoleon made, congratulating them on their conduct, it did seem to them after all that they had won a great victory. The animals slain in the battle were given a solemn funeral. Boxer and Clover pulled the wagon which served as a hearse, and Napoleon himself walked at the head of the procession. Two whole days were given over to celebrations. There were songs, speeches, and more firing of the gun, and a special gift of an apple was bestowed on every animal, with two ounces of corn for each bird and three biscuits for each dog. It was announced that the battle would be called the Battle of the Windmill, and that Napoleon had created a new decoration, the Order of the Green Banner, which he had conferred upon himself. In the general rejoicings the unfortunate affair of the banknotes was forgotten.

It was a few days later than this that the pigs came upon a case of whisky in the cellars of the farmhouse. It had been overlooked at the time when the house was first occupied. That night there came from the farmhouse the sound of loud singing, in which, to everyone's surprise, the strains of "Beasts of England" were mixed up. At about half-past nine Napoleon, wearing an old bowler hat of Mr. Jones's, was distinctly seen to emerge from the back door, gallop rapidly round the yard, and disappear indoors again. But in the morning a deep silence hung over the farmhouse. Not a pig appeared to be stirring. It was nearly nine o'clock when Squealer made his appearance, walking slowly and dejectedly, his eyes dull, his tail hanging limply behind him, and with every appearance of being seriously ill. He called the animals together and told them that he had a terrible piece of news to impart. Comrade Napoleon was dying!

A cry of lamentation went up. Straw was laid down outside the doors of the farmhouse, and the animals walked on tiptoe. With tears in their eyes they asked one another what they should do if their Leader were taken away from them. A rumour went round that Snowball had after all contrived to introduce poison into Napoleon's food. At eleven o'clock Squealer came out to make another announcement. As his last act upon earth, Comrade Napoleon had pronounced a solemn decree: the drinking of alcohol was to be punished by death.

By the evening, however, Napoleon appeared to be somewhat better, and the following morning Squealer was able to tell them that he was well on the way to recovery. By the evening of that day Napoleon was back at work, and on the next day it was learned that he had instructed Whymper to purchase in Willingdon some booklets on brewing and distilling. A week later Napoleon gave orders that the small paddock beyond the orchard, which it had previously been intended to set aside as a grazing-ground for animals who were past work, was to be ploughed up. It was given out that the pasture was exhausted and needed re-seeding; but it soon became known that Napoleon intended to sow it with barley.

About this time there occurred a strange incident which hardly anyone was able to understand. One night at about twelve o'clock there was a loud crash in the yard, and the animals rushed out of their stalls. It was a moonlit night. At the foot of the end wall of the big barn, where the Seven Commandments were written, there lay a ladder broken in two pieces. Squealer, temporarily stunned, was sprawling beside it, and near at hand there lay a lantern, a paint-brush, and an overturned pot of white paint. The dogs immediately made a ring round Squealer, and escorted him back to the farmhouse as soon as he was able to walk. **None of the animals could form any idea as to what this meant, except old Benjamin, who nodded his muzzle with a knowing air, and seemed to understand, but would say nothing.**

But a few days later Muriel, reading over the Seven Commandments to herself, noticed that there was yet another of them which the animals had remembered wrong. **They had thought the Fifth Commandment was "No animal shall drink alcohol," but there were two words that they had forgotten. Actually the Commandment read: "No animal shall drink alcohol to excess."**

## 第 8 章

幾天後，處決造成的恐慌退去，有些動物想起，或認為他們記得，第六誡是這麼規定的：「不可殺害其他同類。」雖然不想讓豬或狗聽到他們議論，但處決行動和這條誡律背道而馳，大家心知肚明。幸運草要班傑明念第六誡給她聽，當班傑明一如往常地表示不願涉入時，幸運草又去找穆里兒幫忙。穆里兒念給她聽，上面寫著：「不可無故殺害其他同類。」不知道為什麼，無故這兩個字從動物們的記憶中消失了。而現在，他們知道拿破崙沒有違反誡律，因為處死和雪球同謀的叛徒具有正當理由。

那一整年裡，動物們比往年更辛勤工作。他們要在預定日期之內重建風車，並且修築起比之前厚兩倍的邊牆。日常農事仍得兼顧，所付出的勞力十分驚人。有時候，動物們覺得自己工作時間增加了，食物配給卻不比瓊斯時代好。每個星期天早晨，尖叫者總拿著一張很長的紙條，念出紙上一長串的數字，證明各種食物的產量皆有成長。依種類不同，有的增加百分之兩百，有的增加百分之三百，有的更達到百分之五百。動物們沒有理由不相信尖叫者，尤其是現在他們已經記不得抗爭前的食物生產狀況。但他們有時候還是會希望能少點數字，多點食物。

現在，所有命令皆由尖叫者或其他豬隻下達，拿破崙每半個月才會公開露面一次。每次現身不但有狗護衛，還有隻黑色小公雞走在前頭。拿破崙開口說話前，小公雞會像號手般大聲啼叫。大家都說，即使在農舍裡，拿破崙也不和其他豬同室而居。他獨自用餐，只有兩條狗在旁服侍，而且還從客廳玻璃櫥櫃內找來皇冠德比高級餐具組，用以進食。豬更宣布，拿破崙生日要比照其他兩個紀念日，每年鳴槍慶祝。

現在，動物們講到拿破崙不再單單只叫他「拿破崙」，而會很正式地稱呼「我們的領袖拿破崙同志」。豬隻們還很喜歡幫他創造一些新的稱號，像是動物之父、人類剋星、羊圈守護者、小鴨之友等等。而尖叫者在發表演講的時候，每每談起拿破崙的聰明才智、慈善心腸、對各地動物的愛以及對其他農莊仍受奴役的無知不幸動物之特別關懷，總會說得涕淚縱橫。大家習慣將所有成就與各種好運都歸功於拿破崙，你常會聽到一隻母雞對另一隻母雞說：「在我們的領袖拿破崙同志領導下，我六天下了五顆蛋。」你也可能聽到兩頭在池邊快樂飲水的牛驚呼：「幸好有拿破崙同志領導我們，這水真是太好喝了！」農莊內的普遍感受都呈現在名為「拿破崙同志」的詩裡，這首詩由小指所作，內容如下：

失怙之友！

幸福之源！

飯桶之主！

啊，汝之眼神沉著威赫，

注視令吾心頭熱，

一如當空之日，

拿破崙同志！

偉大施予者，

各獸所求皆應允，

每日常得二餐飽，潔淨稻草作床靠；

眾獸無論大抑小，

廄棚之內享安眠，

萬獸看護者，

拿破崙同志！

一日使吾得後代，

於其長大成豬前，

縱使酒瓶麵棍小，

皆當學習忠誠表，

誠然，牙牙開口首句詞：

「拿破崙同志！」

拿破崙認可這首詩，還讓動物寫在穀倉牆上正對著七誡的位置。詩的上方是拿破崙的側身像，由尖叫者以白漆繪成。

同時，在溫普仲介下，拿破崙和腓特烈及皮金頓正進行著繁雜的談判。木材目前尚未賣出，兩個買家中，腓特烈意願較為強烈，但卻不想開個合理價錢。在這期間還有新的傳言，說是腓特烈和他手下正密謀攻擊動物農莊，打算摧毀風車這個讓他極為眼紅的建築物。據悉，雪球還躲在狹地農莊裡。仲夏時分，三隻母雞自承在雪球煽動下參與過一項謀殺拿破崙的計畫，動物們聽聞此事皆感到十分訝異。這些母雞立即遭到處死，拿破崙的安全重新受到關切。之後，夜裡總會有四條狗待在他床邊四個角落，負責看守工作。一條年紀較輕的狗名為粉紅眼，他負責在拿破崙進食前試吃所有食物，以免裡面有毒。

大概在這段時間裡，有消息說拿破崙打算把木材賣給皮金頓先生，而且動物農莊和狐林農莊準備簽訂一份長期協議，彼此交換物資。拿破崙與皮金頓之間的關係雖然仍靠溫普居中聯繫，但他倆現在可謂形同朋友。皮金頓是人類，所以其他動物不信任他，但至少他比讓動物們又懼又恨的腓特烈討喜得多。夏季時光緩慢流轉，風車即將竣工，有人會在近日發動奇襲的傳言甚囂塵上。據聞腓特烈打算帶二十名全副武裝的手下攻擊動物農莊，而且他已經花錢收買地方長官和警察，如果拿下動物農莊，那些人也不會過問。此外，狹地農莊裡傳出更恐怖的消息，事關腓特烈如何殘忍對待自己的動物，他活活鞭死一頭老馬、餓死乳牛、把狗丟進火爐裡燒死，而且晚上的娛樂是在雞爪上綁刮鬍刀片，看公雞互鬥。動物們聽到腓特烈對自己同志所做的一切，各個義憤填膺，時而鼓譟說要一起攻擊狹地農莊，驅逐人類、解放動物。但尖叫者勸他們別意氣用事，要相信拿破崙同志的策略。

動物們對腓特烈的反感情緒高漲不退。有個星期天早晨，拿破崙來到穀倉，向動物們解釋他從來沒有想過要把木材賣給腓特烈，說是和那種惡棍交易有損身分。之後，拿破崙禁止四處散布抗爭消息的鴿子在狐林農莊停留，還命令他們把原先的標語「殺死人類」改成「殺死腓特烈」。夏季接近尾聲時，動物們又發現雪球另一個陰謀詭計。那時小麥田裡長滿雜草，大家後來才搞清楚是雪球某天夜裡潛回農莊，把雜草種子和穀物種子混在一起。一隻公鵝當時祕密參與這項計畫，他向尖叫者坦承罪行，馬上被罰吞食有毒莓果自盡。這時，動物們也才知道（因為他們之前一直以為），雪球從來沒有獲頒「動物英雄一等勳章」，這只是牛棚之戰後雪球散布的謠言。實際上他不但沒有獲得勳章，還因為在戰鬥中太過懦弱而遭到譴責。聽了這個說法，有些動物再度感到困惑。但尖叫者立刻說服他們，讓他們相信自己記錯了。

秋天裡，為了兼顧作物的收成，動物們下足苦力。最後，風車終於建好，雖然機械裝置還沒裝上去，目前在等溫普處理購買事宜，但整體結構算是完成了。歷經重重困難，儘管動物們毫無經驗、工具原始、運氣不佳又遭遇雪球背叛，但風車總算在預定日期當天竣工了！動物們雖然筋疲力竭，但都感到十分驕傲，繞著自己的傑作一圈一圈走。在他們眼裡，這座風車比第一次建造的那座還要漂亮，而且它的牆壁有兩倍厚，除了炸藥其他東西都摧毀不了。動物們回想起自己付出多少勞力、克服多少障礙，只要風車翼開始轉動、發電機開始運作，他們的生活將會產生巨大改變。一想到這些，肉體的疲憊一掃而空，大家雀躍地繞著風車，一圈又一圈，不時發出勝利的呼喊。拿破崙在狗和公雞的伴隨下前來視察，親自恭喜動物們達成目標，宣布要將風車命名為拿破崙風車。

兩天後，動物們全被叫到穀倉參加一場特別聚會，拿破崙表示已經將木材賣給腓特烈，而腓特烈的運貨馬車明天就要來載走木材。這讓大家目瞪口呆，因為這段時間裡，拿破崙和皮金頓表面上一直維持朋友關係，實際上卻和腓特烈達成密議。

動物農莊與狐林農莊斷絕往來，還捎了封極羞辱人的信息給皮金頓。拿破崙叫鴿子別去狹地農莊，並把「殺死腓特烈」的口號改成「殺死皮金頓」。同時，拿破崙向動物們保證，奇襲動物農莊的傳言完全是空穴來風，關於腓特烈如何殘忍對待動物的小道消息根本言過其實，所有謠言八成是雪球和他的密探編造的。目前，雪球顯然沒躲在狹地農莊。事實上，他從來就沒有到過那裡，反而是住在狐林農莊，過著極為奢華的生活，過去幾年都靠皮金頓吃喝。

拿破崙老謀深算讓豬隻們高興極了，他表面上和皮金頓化敵為友，其實是要逼腓特烈多出十二鎊。尖叫者說拿破崙誰都不信任，就連腓特烈也懷疑，從這裡能看出他比我們睿智。腓特烈原本打算要用一種叫支票的東西來支付購買木材的費用，這東西似乎是一張紙，上面寫明付款承諾，聰明過人的拿破崙要求他把金額全換成五鎊鈔票來交易，而且木材送出農莊之前就要把錢送到。現在，腓特烈付清費用，他所支付的金額正好足夠買風車的機械裝置。

同時，腓特烈迅速將木材運離農莊。運送工作完結後，農莊穀倉內舉行了另一場特別聚會，動物們集合在一起檢查腓特烈的鈔票。拿破崙笑盈盈地安坐在平台稻草堆中，身上還配戴著兩面動物勳章，腓特烈的錢就擱在他身旁，整整齊齊地擺在從農舍廚房拿來的瓷盤上。動物們排成一排慢慢地走過瓷盤，大家仔仔細細把錢檢查了一次，拳擊手還湊上前聞了聞，輕薄的白色紙鈔隨著鼻息飄動，發出沙沙的聲響。

三天後，農莊內爆發大騷動，溫普臉色死白地騎著腳踏車往農莊直衝。到了院子裡，他把腳踏車一丟，逕自往農舍跑。拿破崙住處隨之傳來一陣可怕的怒吼，怒吼的原因像野火般迅速傳入每隻動物耳裡。那些鈔票是假的！腓特烈沒花半毛錢就得到了木材！

拿破崙立刻把動物們叫了過來，厲聲宣布處腓特烈死刑。他說等抓到腓特烈，一定要把他活活煮死。同時還提醒大家，這次騙局將帶來最糟糕的後果，腓特烈和他的手下任何時候都可能展開計畫多時的攻擊行動。因此，拿破崙在農莊各個通道部署哨兵，還派四隻鴿子到狐林農莊求和，希望能與皮金頓重修舊好。

就在第二天早上，敵手攻勢展開了，當時動物們正在用早餐，哨兵跑進來報告說腓特烈及其手下已經通過柵門，動物們莽撞地衝到他們面前，但沒有像牛棚之戰那樣輕鬆得勝。腓特烈那邊有十五個人，其中一半拿著槍，見動物們進入五十公尺範圍內便開始掃射。雖然拿破崙和拳擊手努力要重整勢力，但大家承受不了爆炸的威力以及尖銳的散彈紛紛往後退，其中有些動物早已為槍彈所傷。他們在倉舍裡避難，小心翼翼地從牆壁裂縫和洞孔往外窺望，整片牧場還有風車皆為敵人所占領。此時，就連拿破崙也有點悵然若失，他不發一語地來回走動，尾巴伸得又長又直，沉思的眼神不時望向狐林農莊。如果皮金頓和他手下願意幫忙，那還是有反敗為勝的機會。然而，就在這個時候，之前派出去的四隻鴿子回來了，其中一隻啣著一張小紙條，皮金頓以鉛筆在上面寫下「你們活該」幾個字。

於此之際，腓特烈及其手下在風車前停下腳步，動物看著他們，紛紛發出失望的悲鳴，兩個男人拿著鐵橇和大錘，打算摧毀風車。

「那是不可能的！」拿破崙喊道：「我們把牆壁蓋得那麼厚，他們一個星期也沒辦法把它拆掉，同志們，我們要有勇氣！」

班傑明專心地注視這些人的一舉一動，只見手持鐵橇和大錘的兩個男人在靠近風車地基的部分鑽了一個洞。班傑明興味盎然地觀看著，緩緩地點了點長長的驢嘴。

「我是這麼想的，」班傑明說：「你們看不出他們在幹嘛嗎？他們等一下就會把火藥塞進那個洞裡。」

飽受驚嚇的動物們靜靜等待，現在要冒險離開倉舍的屏護是不可能的事情。幾分鐘後，他們看著人類四處奔逃，接著是一聲轟然巨響。鴿子朝空中亂竄，除了拿破崙以外，所有動物縮成一團。等大家站起來往外望時，一股黑煙罩住風車所在地，之後隨著微風慢慢飄散，此時，風車已不復存在！

看著眼前這一幕，動物們心中再度萌生勇氣，人類卑鄙無恥的行動令他們勃然大怒，先前所感受到的恐懼與失望消失無蹤。此時，復仇之聲大起，動物們不等拿破崙下令便集體向敵人筆直衝去，這次他們毫不在乎無情的槍彈冰雹般打在身上，一場凶猛暴烈的戰爭於焉展開。人類不斷開槍，又在短兵相接時改用棍棒抽打或隔著厚重的靴子猛踹，一條牛、三頭羊還有兩隻鵝都陣亡了，其他動物幾乎全掛彩，就連在後方指揮作戰的拿破崙也被散彈射中尾巴末端。不過，人類也並非毫髮無傷，有三個人被拳擊手的蹄子踢得頭破血流，還有個人被牛角劃破肚皮，潔西和藍鈴也幾乎把一個人的褲子咬成碎片。拿破崙命令護衛自己的九條狗以籬笆作掩護，出其不意地繞到人類的兩側去，再突然現身瘋狂吠叫，這引起人類一陣恐慌，他們發現自己被包圍了。腓特烈要手下見好就收，於是，這群懦弱的敵人為了保住小命轉身便逃。動物一路追到農田另一端，最後，還在人類鑽過充滿荊棘的籬笆時補上幾腳。

動物贏了但疲憊不堪、血流不止，大家一拐一拐地緩步回到農莊，看到死去的同志僵直地倒在草地上，有些動物不禁哭了出來。動物們在風車曾經矗立之處停了一段時間，靜默無語、內心哀戚。沒錯，風車不見了，幾乎是一絲辛勤搭建的痕跡都沒留下！地基也有部分毀損。如果要重建，他們更沒辦法像上次那樣直接使用垮下來的石頭，因為這次連石頭也全數無影無踪，爆炸的威力把石頭炸飛到幾百公尺外，現場就好像從來沒有建造過風車一般。

當大家走近農莊時，在戰爭中無故缺席的尖叫者終於現身，在大家面前跳來蹦去、甩動尾巴且一臉滿意。接著，動物們聽到從倉舍那邊傳來一聲肅穆的槍響。

拳擊手問：「為什麼要鳴槍？」

「慶祝勝利！」尖叫者喊道。

「什麼勝利？」拳擊手反問，他的膝蓋淌血，蹄鐵掉了一塊，蹄子裂開，十幾顆散彈卡在後腿裡。

「同志，什麼勝利？我們不是把敵人趕出領土了嗎？動物農莊的神聖領土啊？」

「但是他們毀掉風車了，那花了我們兩年才蓋好的！」

「有什麼關係？我們可以再蓋一座，想要的話，蓋六座也行。同志，你沒意識到我們做了件大事，敵人一度占據我們現在所站的這塊土地，但是多虧拿破崙同志領導，我們又把它整個拿回來了。」

「這樣我們就拿回之前屬於我們的東西了。」拳擊手說。

「這是我們的勝利。」尖叫者說。

動物們跛著腳往院子裡走，拳擊手腿內的散彈造成劇痛，他知道接下來要重新建造風車，而且得從地基蓋起，已經開始幻想自己為了這份工作重新振作起來。但是，這一次，他首度意識到自己十一歲了，本來強壯的肌肉或許狀況大不如前。

然而，動物們看著綠色旗幟在空中飄揚，聽見火槍一連鳴響七次，拿破崙還發表了一段演說恭喜大家完成壯舉。最後，大家真的認為自己打了個大勝仗。動物為戰爭中喪命的同志舉辦了隆重的喪禮，運貨馬車充當靈車，由拳擊手與幸運草在前頭拉著，拿破崙則走在隊伍最前端。之後，農莊舉行了兩天的慶祝，大家唱歌、致詞，鳴了很多次槍。所有家畜都收到一顆蘋果作為特別禮物，家禽則獲得兩盎司穀物，狗群的獎勵是三塊狗餅乾。這場戰爭被稱為風車之戰，拿破崙還另創一個新勳章，叫做「綠旗勳章」，並頒給自己。狂歡中，不幸的偽鈔事件也被淡忘了。

過了幾天，豬在農舍酒窖裡偶然找到一瓶威士忌，大家占領房子時都沒有注意到。當晚，農舍裡傳出宏亮的歌聲，教動物們訝異的是歌聲中竟然混雜著〈英格蘭之獸〉的旋律。九點半左右，大家清楚看見拿破崙戴著瓊斯先生的舊圓頂禮帽，從後門跑了出來，飛快地在院子裡繞了一圈，又回到屋子裡去。隔天早上，農舍內一片死寂，所有豬都還沒起床，快要九點的時候才看到尖叫者露面，他腳步緩慢、面容消沉、眼神黯淡、尾巴軟趴趴地垂在身後，怎麼看都是一副病懨懨的模樣。他把動物們集合在一起，說要宣布一件壞消息，拿破崙同志已經命在旦夕！

一時之間，哀嘆聲四起。農舍大門外鋪滿稻草，大家踮起腳尖走路，眼帶淚水地互問，萬一領袖離開他們該如何是好。有傳言說是雪球成功將毒藥放進拿破崙的食物裡，到了十一點尖叫者又出來宣布另一則消息，拿破崙臨走前，最後要訂定一條嚴令：飲酒者死。

然而，到了晚上，拿破崙覺得舒服多了。隔天早晨，尖叫者向動物們表示，拿破崙正順利復原中。當天晚上，拿破崙回到工作崗位。再到隔天，大家聽說他要溫普去威靈頓買一些關於釀造和蒸餾的書籍。一週之後，拿破崙下令將果園旁的那片小牧場闢為耕地，這裡原先是動物退休後養老吃草的地方，現在卻說牧草貧竭，得重新播種。可是，大家沒多久便發現，其實拿破崙打算種大麥。

差不多也是這個時候，農莊內發生了一件讓所有動物不解的怪事。有天半夜，院子裡砰的一聲大響，動物們衝出廄棚。在明月高掛的夜裡，他們看到穀倉寫著七誡的那面牆牆腳下有一把斷成兩半的梯子，尖叫者趴在梯子旁邊，一時回不了神，手邊還有一盞燈、一支油漆刷和一桶打翻了的白漆。狗群旋即圍在尖叫者身旁，等他能走路後便護送他回到農舍。所有動物都搞不懂這是什麼情形，只有老班傑明點著驢嘴，一副了然於心但不願多加評論的樣子。

幾天後，穆里兒自個兒念著七誡，發現大家又記錯其中一誡了。他們以為第五誡是「不可飲酒」，但卻忘了另外兩個字，真正的誡律是：「不可飲酒過量」。

斯大林大元帅，你是全人类的解放者，

今天是你的七十寿辰，我向你高呼万岁！

一个人要活到七十岁，甚至一百岁，

本来并不算得上是什么稀罕的事。

一个人假使无益于人而且有害，

那就让他活到十七岁也未免太多。

但你，全人类的解放者，

你的生命是全世界劳动人民的生命，全人类的生命。

你的七十岁已经救活了不知道好几万的人民！

你的七十岁已经是地质学上的年龄了，

已经是天文学上的年龄了，

你是以宇宙的生命为秋，

你是以宇宙的生命为春。

而且空间不能限制你的伟大，

而且时间不能限制你的长寿，

你已经活了七千亿万恒河沙数地质年，

你还要活下七千亿万恒河沙数天文年，

你是无穷尽，你永远无穷尽！

稀奇的是你已经死了多少次了！

劳动人民的敌人，

帝国主义者，战争贩子，大资本家，大地主，

一切剥削人的吸血者和他们的爪牙，

都诅咒你死，愿望你死，并欣幸你死，

你确确实实是死过多少次了！

但你依然活着，而且还要永远活着！

旧时代的救世主耶稣，死了一次，据说是复活了一次；

新时代的解放者，你，死了多少次，也复活了多少次。

耶稣的死是真的，复活是假的；

而你的死是假的，复活却永远是真的。

我曾经看见过你，你伟大的解放者，

那是一九四五年的六月三十日，

在你的领导之下把纳粹德国消灭了，

拯救了全世界的劳动人民，

恰好迎接了苏联科学院的二百二十周年纪念，

那天晚上你在克里姆林宫欢迎全苏联的学术界的权威，

战斗英雄，劳动英雄，和全世界的进步学者，

你从七点钟入席一直陪到十二点过，

你和全堂的人同欢共乐足足五个小时。

那是多么惊人的健康和毅力啊！

我曾经看见过你，你伟大的解放者，

那是一九四五年的八月二十日，

苏联的人民既消灭了西方的纳粹德国，

又击溃了东方的皇道日本，

集合着十六个共和国的光荣的兄弟，

在红场上进行着体育节的胜利大检阅。

那是光辉灿烂的欢乐的一天，

你在万雷鸣动的欢呼声中出现在伟大列宁的墓上，

从上午十一时站立到下午四时，

你和全场的人同欢共乐更足足站了五个小时。

那是多么惊人的健康和毅力啊！

我曾经看见过你，你伟大的解放者，

那是今年一九四九年的五月一日，

莫斯科举行劳动节的庆祝，

在红场上有二百万人的大游行。

我们从捷克的首都布拉克，

参加了保卫世界和平大会的归途躬逢其盛，

时间虽然相隔了四年，

而日子，依然是那么光辉灿烂的欢乐的日子，

你又在万雷鸣动的欢呼声中站立在伟大列宁的墓上，

从上午十时站立到下午三时，

你和全场的人同欢共乐也足足站了五个小时。

那是多么惊人的健康和毅力啊！

时间尽管流淌，物质尽管流淌，

你的健康和毅力是不变，是永远不变！

你和辨证唯物主义一样永远不变，

你和历史唯物主义一样永远不变，

你和人类实力走向共产主义一样永远不变！

不，这样的称颂或许有背与辨证逻辑吧？

你应该也是在变的，

但是全人类解放者，

你是愈变愈坚强，愈变愈健康，愈变愈不朽了！

不朽的马克思和你同在，你和马克思一样永远不朽了！

不朽的恩格斯和你同在，你和恩格斯一样永远不朽了！

不朽的列宁和你同在，你和列宁一样永远不朽了！

原子弹的威力在你面前只是儿戏，

细菌战的威胁在你面前只是梦呓，

你的光热将使南北两冰洋化为暖流，

你的润泽将使撒哈拉沙漠化为沃土，

你的智慧将使江河改流，山岳奔走，

大地永远年青，人类永远如兄如弟！

斯大林元帅，你全人类的解放者，

今天是你的七十寿辰，我向你高呼万岁！

## Chapter 9


BOXER'S SPLIT HOOF was a long time in healing. They had started the rebuilding of the windmill the day after the victory celebrations were ended. Boxer refused to take even a day off work, and made it a point of honour not to let it be seen that he was in pain. In the evenings he would admit privately to Clover that the hoof troubled him a great deal. Clover treated the hoof with poultices of herbs which she prepared by chewing them, and both she and Benjamin urged Boxer to work less hard. "A horse's lungs do not last for ever," she said to him. But Boxer would not listen. He had, he said, only one real ambition left—to see the windmill well under way before he reached the age for retirement.

At the beginning, when the laws of Animal Farm were first formulated, the retiring age had been fixed for horses and pigs at twelve, for cows at fourteen, for dogs at nine, for sheep at seven, and for hens and geese at five. Liberal old-age pensions had been agreed upon. As yet no animal had actually retired on pension, but of late the subject had been discussed more and more. Now that the small field beyond the orchard had been set aside for barley, it was rumoured that a corner of the large pasture was to be fenced off and turned into a grazing-ground for superannuated animals. For a horse, it was said, the pension would be five pounds of corn a day and, in winter, fifteen pounds of hay, with a carrot or possibly an apple on public holidays. Boxer's twelfth birthday was due in the late summer of the following year.

**Meanwhile life was hard. The winter was as cold as the last one had been, and food was even shorter. Once again all rations were reduced, except those of the pigs and the dogs. A too rigid equality in rations, Squealer explained, would have been contrary to the principles of Animalism. In any case he had no difficulty in proving to the other animals that they were not in reality short of food, whatever the appearances might be. For the time being, certainly, it had been found necessary to make a readjustment of rations (Squealer always spoke of it as a "readjustment," never as a "reduction"), but in comparison with the days of Jones, the improvement was enormous. Reading out the figures in a shrill, rapid voice, he proved to them in detail that they had more oats, more hay, more turnips than they had had in Jones's day, that they worked shorter hours, that their drinking water was of better quality, that they lived longer, that a larger proportion of their young ones survived infancy, and that they had more straw in their stalls and suffered less from fleas. The animals believed every word of it. Truth to tell, Jones and all he stood for had almost faded out of their memories. They knew that life nowadays was harsh and bare, that they were often hungry and often cold, and that they were usually working when they were not asleep. But doubtless it had been worse in the old days. They were glad to believe so. Besides, in those days they had been slaves and now they were free, and that made all the difference, as Squealer did not fail to point out.**

There were many more mouths to feed now. In the autumn the four sows had all littered about simultaneously, producing thirty-one young pigs between them. The young pigs were piebald, and as Napoleon was the only boar on the farm, it was possible to guess at their parentage. It was announced that later, when bricks and timber had been purchased, a schoolroom would be built in the farmhouse garden. For the time being, the young pigs were given their instruction by Napoleon himself in the farmhouse kitchen. They took their exercise in the garden, and were discouraged from playing with the other young animals. About this time, too, it was laid down as a rule that when a pig and any other animal met on the path, the other animal must stand aside: and also that all pigs, of whatever degree, were to have the privilege of wearing green ribbons on their tails on Sundays.

The farm had had a fairly successful year, but was still short of money. There were the bricks, sand, and lime for the schoolroom to be purchased, and it would also be necessary to begin saving up again for the machinery for the windmill. Then there were lamp oil and candles for the house, sugar for Napoleon's own table (he forbade this to the other pigs, on the ground that it made them fat), and all the usual replacements such as tools, nails, string, coal, wire, scrap-iron, and dog biscuits. A stump of hay and part of the potato crop were sold off, and the contract for eggs was increased to six hundred a week, so that that year the hens barely hatched enough chicks to keep their numbers at the same level. Rations, reduced in December, were reduced again in February, and lanterns in the stalls were forbidden to save oil. But the pigs seemed comfortable enough, and in fact were putting on weight if anything. One afternoon in late February a warm, rich, appetising scent, such as the animals had never smelt before, wafted itself across the yard from the little brew-house, which had been dis-used in Jones's time, and which stood beyond the kitchen. Someone said it was the smell of cooking barley. The animals sniffed the air hungrily and wondered whether a warm mash was being prepared for their supper. But no warm mash appeared, and on the following Sunday it was announced that from now onwards all barley would be reserved for the pigs. The field beyond the orchard had already been sown with barley. And the news soon leaked out that every pig was now receiving a ration of a pint of beer daily, with half a gallon for Napoleon himself, which was always served to him in the Crown Derby soup tureen.

**But if there were hardships to be borne, they were partly offset by the fact that life nowadays had a greater dignity than it had had before. There were more songs, more speeches, more processions. Napoleon had commanded that once a week there should be held something called a Spontaneous Demonstration, the object of which was to celebrate the struggles and triumphs of Animal Farm. At the appointed time the animals would leave their work and march round the precincts of the farm in military formation, with the pigs leading, then the horses, then the cows, then the sheep, and then the poultry. The dogs flanked the procession and at the head of all marched Napoleon's black cockerel. Boxer and Clover always carried between them a green banner marked with the hoof and the horn and the caption, "Long live Comrade Napoleon!" Afterwards there were recitations of poems composed in Napoleon's honour, and a speech by Squealer giving particulars of the latest increases in the production of foodstuffs, and on occasion a shot was fired from the gun. The sheep were the greatest devotees of the Spontaneous Demonstration, and if anyone complained (as a few animals sometimes did, when no pigs or dogs were near) that they wasted time and meant a lot of standing about in the cold, the sheep were sure to silence him with a tremendous bleating of "Four legs good, two legs bad!" But by and large the animals enjoyed these celebrations. They found it comforting to be reminded that, after all, they were truly their own masters and that the work they did was for their own benefit. So that, what with the songs, the processions, Squealer's lists of figures, the thunder of the gun, the crowing of the cockerel, and the fluttering of the flag, they were able to forget that their bellies were empty, at least part of the time.**

In April, Animal Farm was proclaimed a Republic, and it became necessary to elect a President. There was only one candidate, Napoleon, who was elected unanimously. On the same day it was given out that fresh documents had been discovered which revealed further details about Snowball's complicity with Jones. It now appeared that Snowball had not, as the animals had previously imagined, merely attempted to lose the Battle of the Cowshed by means of a stratagem, but had been openly fighting on Jones's side. In fact, it was he who had actually been the leader of the human forces, and had charged into battle with the words "Long live Humanity!" on his lips. The wounds on Snowball's back, which a few of the animals still remembered to have seen, had been inflicted by Napoleon's teeth.

In the middle of the summer Moses the raven suddenly reappeared on the farm, after an absence of several years. He was quite unchanged, still did no work, and talked in the same strain as ever about Sugarcandy Mountain. He would perch on a stump, flap his black wings, and talk by the hour to anyone who would listen. "Up there, comrades," he would say solemnly, pointing to the sky with his large beak—"up there, just on the other side of that dark cloud that you can see—there it lies, Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours!" He even claimed to have been there on one of his higher flights, and to have seen the everlasting fields of clover and the linseed cake and lump sugar growing on the hedges. Many of the animals believed him. Their lives now, they reasoned, were hungry and laborious; was it not right and just that a better world should exist somewhere else? A thing that was difficult to determine was the attitude of the pigs towards Moses. They all declared contemptuously that his stories about Sugarcandy Mountain were lies, and yet they allowed him to remain on the farm, not working, with an allowance of a gill of beer a day.

After his hoof had healed up, Boxer worked harder than ever. Indeed, all the animals worked like slaves that year. Apart from the regular work of the farm, and the rebuilding of the windmill, there was the schoolhouse for the young pigs, which was started in March. Sometimes the long hours on insufficient food were hard to bear, but Boxer never faltered. In nothing that he said or did was there any sign that his strength was not what it had been. It was only his appearance that was a little altered; his hide was less shiny than it had used to be, and his great haunches seemed to have shrunken. The others said, "Boxer will pick up when the spring grass comes on"; but the spring came and Boxer grew no fatter. Sometimes on the slope leading to the top of the quarry, when he braced his muscles against the weight of some vast boulder, it seemed that nothing kept him on his feet except the will to continue. At such times his lips were seen to form the words, "I will work harder"; he had no voice left. Once again Clover and Benjamin warned him to take care of his health, but Boxer paid no attention. His twelfth birthday was approaching. He did not care what happened so long as a good store of stone was accumulated before he went on pension.

Late one evening in the summer, a sudden rumour ran round the farm that something had happened to Boxer. He had gone out alone to drag a load of stone down to the windmill. And sure enough, the rumour was true. A few minutes later two pigeons came racing in with the news: "Boxer has fallen! He lying on his side and can't get up!"

About half the animals on the farm rushed out to the knoll where the windmill stood. There lay Boxer, between the shafts of the cart, his neck stretched out, unable even to raise his head. His eyes were glazed, his sides matted with sweat. A thin stream of blood had trickled out of his mouth. Clover dropped to her knees at his side.

"Boxer!" she cried, "how are you?"

"It is my lung," said Boxer in a weak voice. "It does not matter. I think you will be able to finish the windmill without me. There is a pretty good store of stone accumulated. I had only another month to go in any case. To tell you the truth, I had been looking forward to my retirement. And perhaps, as Benjamin is growing old too, they will let him retire at the same time and be a companion to me."

"We must get help at once," said Clover. "Run, somebody, and tell Squealer what has happened."

All the other animals immediately raced back to the farmhouse to give Squealer the news. Only Clover remained, and Benjamin, who lay down at Boxer's side, and, without speaking, kept the flies off him with his long tail. After about a quarter of an hour Squealer appeared, full of sympathy and concern. He said that Comrade Napoleon had learned with the very deepest distress of this misfortune to one of the most loyal workers on the farm, and was already making arrangements to send Boxer to be treated in the hospital at Willingdon. The animals felt a little uneasy at this. Except for Mollie and Snowball, no other animal had ever left the farm, and they did not like to think of their sick comrade in the hands of human beings. However, Squealer easily convinced them that the veterinary surgeon in Willingdon could treat Boxer's case more satisfactorily than could be done on the farm. And about half an hour later, when Boxer had somewhat recovered, he was with difficulty got on to his feet, and managed to limp back to his stall, where Clover and Benjamin had prepared a good bed of straw for him.

For the next two days Boxer remained in his stall. The pigs had sent out a large bottle of pink medicine which they had found in the medicine chest in the bathroom, and Clover administered it to Boxer twice a day after meals. In the evenings she lay in his stall and talked to him, while Benjamin kept the flies off him. Boxer professed not to be sorry for what had happened. If he made a good recovery, he might expect to live another three years, and he looked forward to the peaceful days that he would spend in the corner of the big pasture. It would be the first time that he had had leisure to study and improve his mind. He intended, he said, to devote the rest of his life to learning the remaining twenty-two letters of the alphabet.

However, Benjamin and Clover could only be with Boxer after working hours, and it was in the middle of the day when the van came to take him away. The animals were all at work weeding turnips under the supervision of a pig, when they were astonished to see Benjamin come galloping from the direction of the farm buildings, braying at the top of his voice. It was the first time that they had ever seen Benjamin excited—indeed, it was the first time that anyone had ever seen him gallop. "Quick, quick!" he shouted. "Come at once! They're taking Boxer away!" Without waiting for orders from the pig, the animals broke off work and raced back to the farm buildings. Sure enough, there in the yard was a large closed van, drawn by two horses, with lettering on its side and a sly-looking man in a low-crowned bowler hat sitting on the driver's seat. And Boxer's stall was empty.

The animals crowded round the van. "Good-bye, Boxer!" they chorused, "good-bye!"

"Fools! Fools!" shouted Benjamin, prancing round them and stamping the earth with his small hoofs. "Fools! Do you not see what is written on the side of that van?"

**That gave the animals pause, and there was a hush. Muriel began to spell out the words. But Benjamin pushed her aside and in the midst of a deadly silence he read:**

**"'Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler, Willingdon. Dealer in Hides and Bone-Meal. Kennels Supplied.' Do you not understand what that means? They are taking Boxer to the knacker's!"**

A cry of horror burst from all the animals. At this moment the man on the box whipped up his horses and the van moved out of the yard at a smart trot. All the animals followed, crying out at the tops of their voices. Clover forced her way to the front. The van began to gather speed. Clover tried to stir her stout limbs to a gallop, and achieved a canter. "Boxer!" she cried. "Boxer! Boxer! Boxer!" And just at this moment, as though he had heard the uproar outside, Boxer's face, with the white stripe down his nose, appeared at the small window at the back of the van.

"Boxer!" cried Clover in a terrible voice. "Boxer! Get out! Get out quickly! They're taking you to your death!"

All the animals took up the cry of "Get out, Boxer, get out!" But the van was already gathering speed and drawing away from them. It was uncertain whether Boxer had understood what Clover had said. But a moment later his face disappeared from the window and there was the sound of a tremendous drumming of hoofs inside the van. He was trying to kick his way out. The time had been when a few kicks from Boxer's hoofs would have smashed the van to matchwood. But alas! his strength had left him; and in a few moments the sound of drumming hoofs grew fainter and died away. In desperation the animals began appealing to the two horses which drew the van to stop. "Comrades, comrades!" they shouted. "Don't take your own brother to his death!" But the stupid brutes, too ignorant to realise what was happening, merely set back their ears and quickened their pace. Boxer's face did not reappear at the window Too late, someone thought of racing ahead and shutting the five-barred gate; but in another moment the van was through it and rapidly disappearing down the road. Boxer was never seen again.

Three days later it was announced that he had died in the hospital at Willingdon, in spite of receiving every attention a horse could have. Squealer came to announce the news to the others. He had, he said, been present during Boxer's last hours.

"It was the most affecting sight I have ever seen!" said Squealer, lifting his trotter and wiping away a tear. "I was at his bedside at the very last. And at the end, almost too weak to speak, he whispered in my ear that his sole sorrow was to have passed on before the windmill was finished. 'Forward, comrades!' he whispered. 'Forward in the name of the Rebellion. Long live Animal Farm! Long live Comrade Napoleon! Napoleon is always right.' Those were his very last words, comrades."

Here Squealer's demeanour suddenly changed. He fell silent for a moment, and his little eyes darted suspicious glances from side to side before he proceeded.

It had come to his knowledge, he said, that a foolish and wicked rumour had been circulated at the time of Boxer's removal. Some of the animals had noticed that the van which took Boxer away was marked "Horse Slaughterer," and had actually jumped to the conclusion that Boxer was being sent to the knacker's. It was almost unbelievable, said Squealer, that any animal could be so stupid. Surely, he cried indignantly, whisking his tail and skipping from side to side, surely they knew their beloved Leader, Comrade Napoleon, better than that? But the explanation was really very simple. The van had previously been the property of the knacker, and had been bought by the veterinary surgeon, who had not yet painted the old name out. That was how the mistake had arisen.

The animals were enormously relieved to hear this. And when Squealer went on to give further graphic details of Boxer's deathbed, the admirable care he had received, and the expensive meditines for which Napoleon had paid without a thought as to the cost, their last doubts disappeared and the sorrow that they felt for their comrade's death was tempered by the thought that at least he had died happy.

**Napoleon himself appeared at the meeting on the following Sunday morning and pronounced a short oration in Boxer's honour. It had not been possible, he said, to bring back their lamented comrade's remains for interment on the farm, but he had ordered a large wreath to be made from the laurels in the farmhouse garden and sent down to be placed on Boxer's grave. And in a few days' time the pigs intended to hold a memorial banquet in Boxer's honour. Napoleon ended his speech with a reminder of Boxer's two favourite maxims, "I will work harder" and "Comrade Napoleon is always right"—maxims, he said, which every animal would do well to adopt as his own.**

On the day appointed for the banquet, a grocer's van drove up from Willingdon and delivered a large wooden crate at the farmhouse. That night there was the sound of uproarious singing, which was followed by what sounded like a violent quarrel and ended at about eleven o'clock with a tremendous crash of glass. **No one stirred in the farmhouse before noon on the following day, and the word went round that from somewhere or other the pigs had acquired the money to buy themselves another case of whisky.**

## 第 9 章

拳擊手裂開的蹄子過了好長一段時間才復原，而動物們在慶祝活動後便著手重建風車。拳擊手連一天假都不肯放，忍著痛不讓其他動物發現，並以此為榮。只有在夜裡，他才會私下向幸運草坦承受傷的蹄子造成他很大的麻煩。幸運草總會將咀嚼過的藥草泥敷在拳擊手的蹄子上，也常和班傑明一起勸拳擊手別那麼拚命，她說：「馬的肺不可能永遠不出問題。」但拳擊手就是不聽，總說他現在只有一個目標，便是在退休之前看到風車順利運作。

動物農莊的律法剛制訂時，馬和豬的退休年齡為十二歲、牛十四歲、狗九歲、羊七歲、母雞和鵝五歲，而且還慷慨地規定要發老年津貼給退休動物。然而，至今還沒有動物領津貼退休，這個話題最近也愈炒愈熱。果園邊的小牧場現在被拿來種大麥，所以有傳言說，大牧場一隅將會以柵欄圈起來，改成退休動物養老吃草的地方。傳言還說馬的津貼是每日五磅穀物，冬天則為十五磅乾草，法定假日有紅蘿蔔或蘋果吃。來年夏末，拳擊手就要過十二歲生日了。

這段時間裡，動物們的生活十分艱苦，冬天像去年一樣寒冷，糧食卻更短缺。因而除了豬和狗以外，其他動物的食物配給再度縮水了，尖叫者解釋說，太過強調配給平等有違動物主義原則。不管情勢如何變化，尖叫者總能輕易向其他動物證明食物實際上並沒有短缺。現在這種時候，配給是需要調整一下（「調整」是尖叫者慣用的字眼，他從不說「短缺」），但和瓊斯時代比起來還是好很多。尖叫者以刺耳又急促的聲音念出數據，仔細地向動物們證明，與瓊斯時代相較，目前貯藏的燕麥、乾草和蘿蔔更為可觀、工時較短、飲用水較為純淨、動物壽命更長、幼年動物存活率提升、廄棚內有更多稻草且跳蚤減少了，動物們全都信以為真。老實說，動物們已經幾乎記不得瓊斯和他那個時代的事情了。他們只知道目前的生活很艱苦，常常得挨餓受凍，而且睜開眼就是工作。不過，無庸置疑地，過去的日子比現在還慘，他們很樂意這麼想。尖叫者還不忘補上，以前大家是奴隸，現在則是自由之身，這可說天差地遠。

現在，農莊內有更多張嘴吃飯。秋天時，四頭母豬幾乎同時分娩，總共產下三十一頭雜色小豬。農莊裡的種豬只有拿破崙，因此他們的父母是誰並不難猜。豬宣布，等購得磚塊和木材後，農舍花園裡將會蓋一間教室。在那之前，拿破崙會在農舍廚房內親自教導這些小豬。小豬們在花園裡運動，禁止和其他幼年動物玩耍。也差不多這個時候，農莊內又多了一條規定，當一隻豬和其他動物在路上相遇時，其他動物必須站到一邊去。此外，每個星期天，所有豬隻不論身分都可以繫綠色緞帶在尾巴上，這是他們的特權。

農莊這一年萬事順利，但是財源依舊短缺，現在等著要買磚塊、泥沙和石灰來蓋教室，也得為風車的機械裝置再次存錢，還要添購農舍照明用的燈油及蠟燭、拿破崙專用餐桌的糖（他禁止其他豬隻吃糖，理由是他們會愈來愈胖）以及所有日常消耗品，如各種工具、釘子、繩子、煤炭、鐵絲、廢鐵和狗餅乾。目前，剩下的乾草還有部分馬鈴薯都賣掉了，賣蛋合約做了修改，每週交貨數量增加到六百顆蛋，結果母雞那年孵化的小雞不夠，造成雞隻總數下降。十二月才減少過一次的食物配給二月又縮水了，而且為了節省燈油，廄棚禁止點燈。不過，豬隻過得似乎還滿愜意的，實際上甚至都胖了幾公斤。二月底某天下午，空氣中飄來一陣新鮮、濃郁、讓人垂涎三尺的香味，這股動物們以前從來沒有聞過的氣息從小釀造坊那兒傳遍整個院子。小釀造坊在廚房旁邊，瓊斯時代就已經廢棄不用。有動物說那聞起來像煮大麥的味道，動物們飢腸轆轆地嗅著，心裡猜測晚餐不知道有沒有暖呼呼的麥糊吃，但是並沒有什麼暖呼呼的麥糊。到了接下來的那個星期天，豬隻宣布今後所有大麥均歸他們食用。沒多久，有消息走漏，說每隻豬每天有一品脫的啤酒配給，拿破崙自己則享有半加侖，而且他的啤酒都用皇冠德比高級湯碗盛裝。

然而，舉凡碰到什麼困難，動物們多少會安慰自己現在的生活比以前更有尊嚴。農莊內有愈來愈多的歌曲、演講和遊行，拿破崙下令每週舉辦一次名叫「自發表演」的活動，目的在於讚揚動物農莊的奮鬥與勝利。指定的時間一到，動物們便得離開工作崗位，行軍般繞農莊一圈。遊行隊伍由豬帶頭，接著依序是馬、牛、羊、家禽，狗走在隊伍兩旁，最前面則是拿破崙的黑公雞。拳擊手及幸運草總一起咬著一塊綠色布條，上面畫有蹄子和角以及「拿破崙同志萬歲！」幾個大字。詩作朗誦會在遊行後舉辦，所有作品的主題都在歌頌拿破崙。接著則是尖叫者演講時間，通常在細數最近食物產量的增加情形。除此之外，時而會有鳴槍儀式。綿羊是自發表演最熱情的參與者，如果有動物犯嘀咕（有些動物偶爾會趁豬或狗不在身邊的時候發些牢騷），覺得這是在浪費時間，還得在寒冷的天氣中站那麼久，羊群便會放聲高喊「四足善，雙足惡」來讓抱怨的動物閉嘴。不過，動物們大致上還滿喜歡這些慶祝活動的，那讓他們體會到自己是真正的主人、所做的工作都是為了自己，進而從中獲得慰藉。在歌曲、遊行、尖叫者的一長串數據、鳴槍聲、雞啼聲和飄揚的旗幟中，動物們忘記飢餓之苦，或至少暫時將之拋到腦後。

四月時分，動物農莊宣布組成共和國，需要選出一位總統，而候選人只有拿破崙一個，所以全體贊成通過。同一天，有消息說找到了新的文件證據，能夠進一步證明雪球和瓊斯狼狽為奸。而且現在看來雪球不只如大家所想的打算耍詭計輸掉牛棚之戰，他還公開幫瓊斯做事。實際上，他才是人類的首領。衝進戰場時，他嘴裡喊的是「人類萬歲」。有些動物還記得看過雪球背上的傷，其實那是拿破崙咬的。

夏天過完一半，消失好幾年的烏鴉摩西突然回到農莊。他沒什麼改變，還是不工作，整天講糖果山之類的事情。摩西常常站在樹枝上，拍動黑色翅膀，一小時、兩小時地向有興趣的動物們敘述。「同志，在那上面，」他的黑色大鳥嘴指著天空，語氣嚴肅地說：「在那上面，你眼前那片烏雲的另一端，糖果山就在那裡，那是歡樂之地，我們這些可憐的動物到那裡就不需再工作，永遠得歇息！」摩西甚至聲稱他偶爾飛得很高，有一次曾飛到那裡去。他在山上看到綿延不絕的苜蓿，還有亞麻仁餅和糖塊長在籬笆上。很多動物相信摩西說的話，他們的理由是現在的生活又餓又累，世界上有個更美好的地方不是天經地義的事情嗎？不過，豬對摩西的態度曖昧不明，他們輕蔑地表示糖果山是編造出來的，可是卻又讓摩西繼續待在農莊裡，不需工作，每天還有四分之一品脫的啤酒喝。

拳擊手蹄傷復原後，工作比以往更加賣力。說實話，動物們那一年都如奴隸般工作，除了固定要處理的農事和重建風車之外，三月的時候又開始忙著為小豬蓋教室。做得多吃得少有時總讓動物難以忍受，但拳擊手始終如一，他所說的每句話、所做的每件事都顯示自己的氣力一如過往，只是他的外表有了些許不同，皮毛變得較沒光澤，原本粗壯的後腿也消瘦了。其他動物總說：「等地上長出春草，拳擊手就會胖回來了。」然而，春草是長出來了，拳擊手卻沒有胖回來。在將石頭往礦場斜坡上拉的過程中，當拳擊手繃緊肌肉穩住又重又大的石塊時，他偶爾會覺得自己之所以能撐下去完全是靠意志力。每當這種時候，動物們就會看見拳擊手嘴裡默念著：「我要更努力。」幸運草和班傑明再次提醒拳擊手要注意健康，但他就是不聽，隨著十二歲生日即將來臨，他現在什麼都不在乎，只想在領津貼退休之前收集好足夠的石塊。

某個夏夜，太陽才剛下山不久，一個消息在農莊內傳開，說拳擊手出事了，當時他獨自出門拉了一車石頭到風車工地去。傳言是真的，幾分鐘後，兩隻鴿子急急忙忙飛回來，說：「拳擊手倒下去了！他側身倒在地上，站不起來！」

農莊內半數動物皆往風車矗立的山丘衝去，拳擊手就倒在那裡，在推車的兩根把手之間。他脖子伸得長長的，頭抬不起來，眼神呆滯、全身冒汗，嘴裡還流出細細血絲。幸運草見狀，屈膝跪在拳擊手身旁。

「拳擊手！」幸運草喊道：「你還好嗎？」

「我的肺出問題了，」拳擊手有氣無力地說：「但是沒關係，我相信你們沒有我也能蓋好風車，現在，石頭已經收集得夠多了，而我大概只剩一個月能幹活。老實說，我一直很期待退休，而且，班傑明也愈來愈老了，或許他們會同意讓他同時退休，好跟我作伴。」

「我們得馬上求救，」幸運草說：「誰趕快去跟尖叫者說這件事情？」

其他動物全跑回農舍向尖叫者報告，只剩下幸運草與班傑明陪著拳擊手，班傑明不發一語地趴在他身邊，甩著長長的尾巴替他趕蒼蠅。約莫過了十五分鐘，尖叫者滿臉同情與關心地來到現場，表示拿破崙同志已經聽說這項萬分悲慘的消息，知道農莊最忠誠工作者的不幸遭遇，且已安排好要將拳擊手送到威靈頓的醫院去。大家對此覺得有些不妥，除了莫莉和雪球以外，其他動物沒有離開過農莊，也不希望生病的同志接受人類治療。然而，尖叫者輕易地說服了他們，他說威靈頓的獸醫比農莊動物更能診治拳擊手。大約半小時後，拳擊手比較好過一點，便吃力地站起身，一拐一拐地往馬廄走。在那裡，幸運草與班傑明已經為他鋪好一層舒服的稻草。

接下來兩天，拳擊手都待在自己的馬廄裡，豬從浴室藥櫃中找到一大罐粉紅色藥水，由幸運草負責每天兩餐餐後餵拳擊手喝。在夜裡，幸運草待在拳擊手的馬廄內和他聊天，班傑明則在一旁幫他趕蒼蠅。拳擊手跟他們說自己不覺得難過，如果復原良好，那還能多活三年呢！他很期待生活於大牧場一隅的平靜時光，那將是他有生以來第一次有空好好學習以增長智慧，他表示打算用剩餘的時光來學習剩下的二十二個字母。

不過，班傑明和幸運草只有在工作結束以後才能陪拳擊手，而他就在某天中午被有篷大馬車運走了。當時，動物們在豬監督下於蘿蔔田裡除草。突然間，班傑明從倉舍那裡跑來，並且放聲大叫，讓大家嚇了一跳，這是他們第一次看到班傑明這麼激動。實際上，這是大家第一次看到他跑起來。「快點！快點！」他嚷嚷著：「趕快過來！他們要把拳擊手帶走了！」動物們不等豬下令，馬上丟下工作往倉舍跑。想當然耳，院子裡有一輛車門緊閉的馬車，前頭有兩匹馬拉著，車身還刻了些字，車夫座坐了一名面容狡獪的男人，頭上的圓頂禮帽帽沿壓得低低的。拳擊手的馬廄空空如也。

大家擠向馬車，齊聲喊道：「再見！拳擊手，再見！」

「傻瓜！傻瓜！」班傑明大聲叫道，他繞著動物們跳來蹬去，瘦小的蹄子不停跺著地面：「傻瓜！你們沒有看到馬車那一邊寫了什麼字嗎？」

這讓大家停了下來，現場頓時一片靜默。穆里兒慢慢地拼出車身上的字，但班傑明將她推到旁邊，在一片死寂中念道：

「『阿飛席蒙斯．威靈頓屠馬商兼煮膠商．皮毛與骨粉販售商．狗屋供應商』，你們不明白那是什麼意思嗎？他們要把拳擊手送到屠馬業者那裡去！」

所有動物嚇得尖叫，此時，車夫座上的男人抽打馬匹，馬車輕快地駛出院子。動物們跟在後頭，使盡全力大叫，而馬車速度愈來愈快，幸運草擠到前頭，試著要抬起肥胖的四肢加速奔跑，但速度僅僅差強人意。「拳擊手！」她大喊：「拳擊手！拳擊手！拳擊手！」就在這個時候，拳擊手彷彿聽到外頭的喧嚷，把那張白色條紋一直延伸到鼻頭的臉湊近馬車後頭的小窗。

「拳擊手！」幸運草厲聲叫道：「拳擊手！出來！快出來！他們要把你送去屠宰場！」

所有動物跟著喊：「出來，拳擊手，出來！」但馬車已經加速駛離，大家不確定拳擊手是否聽懂幸運草對他說的話。過沒多久，他的臉消失在窗後，接著，車內傳來蹄子踹擊的巨大聲響，拳擊手試圖要踹破車門。只差幾下就能把車門踢成碎片了，可是，唉！拳擊手已經氣力用盡，蹄子踹擊聲愈來愈弱，最後終於消失。絕望之餘，動物們不斷懇求拉馬車的那兩匹馬停下腳步，他們叫道：「同志們！同志們！不要把你們的弟兄帶去送死！」但這兩頭笨馬完全不知道發生什麼事情，只管把耳朵貼緊頭部並加快速度。拳擊手的臉沒有再次出現在窗戶另一邊，一切都太遲了，有動物想衝到前面去關上柵門，可是馬車已然通過，迅速消失在路的那一頭。從此，大家沒有再見過拳擊手。

三天後，大家得知，拳擊手在威靈頓的醫院內接受各種適合馬的治療方式，但仍舊回天乏術。尖叫者向其他動物傳達這則消息，還表示自己陪拳擊手走完最後幾個小時。

「那是我這輩子見過最感傷的一幕！」尖叫者一邊舉起蹄子拭淚一邊說：「我一直到最後都待在他床邊，幾乎沒有力氣說話的拳擊手在我耳邊輕輕地說，他唯一的遺憾是沒能在死前看到風車完工。他還細聲喊著：『同志們，前進！以抗爭之名前進。動物農莊萬歲！拿破崙同志萬歲！拿破崙永遠是對的。』同志們，這就是他最後的遺言。」

一說完這段話，尖叫者態度突然改變，先是沉默了一會兒，小小的眼睛滿是猜疑地掃視在場動物，然後才又繼續講下去。

他表示，在拳擊手被送走的時候，聽說動物之間流傳著一個愚蠢、缺德的謠言。有些動物注意到，載走拳擊手的馬車上標有「屠馬商」幾個字，於是便下了個結論，說拳擊手被送到屠馬業者那裡去了。尖叫者說，有動物笨到這種地步實在讓他不敢置信，他跳來蹦去、甩動尾巴憤慨地說，你們應該知道，親愛的領袖拿破崙同志不會做這種事情，對吧？事情其實非常單純，那輛馬車先前為屠馬業者所有，之後由獸醫買走，只是車身上的舊名字還沒塗掉，這就是產生誤會的原因。

一聽完解釋，動物們大為寬心。尖叫者進一步生動描述拳擊手死前所躺的床、當時所接受的完善照護以及拿破崙不計價格所購買的昂貴藥物，這讓大家的疑慮一掃而空。至少，拳擊手走得很愉快，想到這裡，同志死去的哀傷不再那麼強烈了。

拿破崙在接下來那個星期天的早晨聚會中現身，簡短地發表了一段演說頌揚拳擊手。他說大家都很懷念這位同志，雖然沒辦法將他的遺體運回農莊安葬，但他已下令從農舍花園採摘月桂做成大花圈，送到拳擊手墳上。此外，豬群還打算在幾天後舉辦拳擊手追悼宴。演講末尾，拿破崙重述了一次拳擊手最愛的兩句格言：「我要更努力」、「拿破崙同志永遠是對的」，他表示所有動物都該謹記在心。

追悼宴當天，一輛從威靈頓來的食品商馬車進入農莊，在農舍外擱下一只大木箱。當晚，農舍內傳來喧鬧的歌聲，接著似乎是一陣劇烈爭吵。十一點左右爆出了巨大的玻璃碎裂聲，之後一切歸於平靜。農舍裡的豬一直到隔天中午才醒來，有傳言說豬不知道從哪籌到錢，買了一箱威士忌。



## Chapter 10


YEARS PASSED. The seasons came and went, the short animal lives fled by. A time came when there was no one who remembered the old days before the Rebellion, except Clover, Benjamin, Moses the raven, and a number of the pigs.

**Muriel was dead; Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher were dead. Jones too was dead—he had died in an inebriates' home in another part of the county. Snowball was forgotten. Boxer was forgotten, except by the few who had known him. Clover was an old stout mare now, stiff in the joints and with a tendency to rheumy eyes. She was two years past the retiring age, but in fact no animal had ever actually retired. The talk of setting aside a corner of the pasture for superannuated animals had long since been dropped. Napoleon was now a mature boar of twenty-four stone. Squealer was so fat that he could with difficulty see out of his eyes. Only old Benjamin was much the same as ever, except for being a little greyer about the muzzle, and, since Boxer's death, more morose and taciturn than ever.**

There were many more creatures on the farm now, though the increase was not so great as had been expected in earlier years. Many animals had been born to whom the Rebellion was only a dim tradition, passed on by word of mouth, and others had been bought who had never heard mention of such a thing before their arrival. The farm possessed three horses now besides Clover. They were fine upstanding beasts, willing workers and good comrades, but very stupid. None of them proved able to learn the alphabet beyond the letter B. They accepted everything that they were told about the Rebellion and the principles of Animalism, especially from Clover, for whom they had an almost filial respect; but it was doubtful whether they understood very much of it.

The farm was more prosperous now, and better organised: it had even been enlarged by two fields which had been bought from Mr. Pilkington. The windmill had been successfully completed at last, and the farm possessed a threshing machine and a hay elevator of its own, and various new buildings had been added to it. Whymper had bought himself a dogcart. The windmill, however, had not after all been used for generating electrical power. It was used for milling corn, and brought in a handsome money profit. The animals were hard at work building yet another windmill; when that one was finished, so it was said, the dynamos would be installed. But the luxuries of which Snowball had once taught the animals to dream, the stalls with electric light and hot and cold water, and the three-day week, were no longer talked about. Napoleon had denounced such ideas as contrary to the spirit of Animalism. The truest happiness he said, lay in working hard and living frugally.

Somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the animals themselves any richer—except, of course, for the pigs and the dogs. Perhaps this was partly because there were so many pigs and so many dogs. It was not that these creatures did not work, after their fashion. There was, as Squealer was never tired of explaining, endless work in the supervision and organisation of the farm. Much of this work was of a kind that the other animals were too ignorant to understand. For example, Squealer told them that the pigs had to expend enormous labours every day upon mysterious things called "files," "reports," "minutes," and "memoranda." These were large sheets of paper which had to be closely covered with writing, and as soon as they were so covered, they were burnt in the furnace. This was of the highest importance for the welfare of the farm, Squealer said. But still, neither pigs nor dogs produced any food by their own labour; and there were very many of them, and their appetites were always good.

As for the others, their life, so far as they knew, was as it had always been. They were generally hungry, they slept on straw, they drank from the pool, they laboured in the fields; in winter they were troubled by the cold, and in summer by the flies. Sometimes the older ones among them racked their dim memories and tried to determine whether in the early days of the Rebellion, when Jones's expulsion was still recent, things had been better or worse than now. They could not remember. There was nothing with which they could compare their present lives: they had nothing to go upon except Squealer's lists of figures, which invariably demonstrated that everything was getting better and better. The animals found the problem insoluble; in any case, they had little time for speculating on such things now. **Only old Benjamin professed to remember every detail of his long life and to know that things never had been, nor ever could be much better or much worse—hunger, hardship, and disappointment being, so he said, the unalterable law of life.**

**And yet the animals never gave up hope. More, they never lost, even for an instant, their sense of honour and privilege in being members of Animal Farm. They were still the only farm in the whole county—in all England!—owned and operated by animals. Not one of them, not even the youngest, not even the newcomers who had been brought from farms ten or twenty miles away, ever ceased to marvel at that. And when they heard the gun booming and saw the green flag fluttering at the masthead, their hearts swelled with imperishable pride, and the talk turned always towards the old heroic days, the expulsion of Jones, the writing of the Seven Commandments, the great battles in which the human invaders had been defeated. None of the old dreams had been abandoned. The Republic of the Animals which Major had foretold, when the green fields of England should be untrodden by human feet, was still believed in. Some day it was coming: it might not be soon, it might not be within the lifetime of any animal now living, but still it was coming. Even the tune of "Beasts of England" was perhaps hummed secretly here and there: at any rate, it was a fact that every animal on the farm knew it, though no one would have dared to sing it aloud. It might be that their lives were hard and that not all of their hopes had been fulfilled; but they were conscious that they were not as other animals. If they went hungry, it was not from feeding tyrannical human beings; if they worked hard, at least they worked for themselves. No creature among them went upon two legs. No creature called any other creature "Master." All animals were equal.**

One day in early summer Squealer ordered the sheep to follow him, and led them out to a piece of waste ground at the other end of the farm, which had become overgrown with birch saplings. The sheep spent the whole day there browsing at the leaves under Squealer's supervision. In the evening he returned to the farmhouse himself, but, as it was warm weather, told the sheep to stay where they were. It ended by their remaining there for a whole week, during which time the other animals saw nothing of them. Squealer was with them for the greater part of every day. He was, he said, teaching them to sing a new song, for which privacy was needed.

It was just after the sheep had returned, on a pleasant evening when the animals had finished work and were making their way back to the farm buildings, that the terrified neighing of a horse sounded from the yard. Startled, the animals stopped in their tracks. It was Clover's voice. She neighed again, and all the animals broke into a gallop and rushed into the yard. Then they saw what Clover had seen.

It was a pig walking on his hind legs.

Yes, it was Squealer. A little awkwardly, as though not quite used to supporting his considerable bulk in that position, but with perfect balance, he was strolling across the yard. And a moment later, out from the door of the farmhouse came a long file of pigs, all walking on their hind legs. Some did it better than others, one or two were even a trifle unsteady and looked as though they would have liked the support of a stick, but every one of them made his way right round the yard successfully. And finally there was a tremendous baying of dogs and a shrill crowing from the black cockerel, and out came Napoleon himself, majestically upright, casting haughty glances from side to side, and with his dogs gambolling round him.

**He carried a whip in his trotter.**

**There was a deadly silence. Amazed, terrified, huddling together, the animals watched the long line of pigs march slowly round the yard. It was as though the world had turned upside-down. Then there came a moment when the first shock had worn off and when, in spite of everything—in spite of their terror of the dogs, and of the habit, developed through long years, of never complaining, never criticising, no matter what happened—they might have uttered some word of protest. But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of—**

**"Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!"**

It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse.

Benjamin felt a nose nuzzling at his shoulder. He looked round. It was Clover. Her old eyes looked dimmer than ever. Without saying anything, she tugged gently at his mane and led him round to the end of the big barn, where the Seven Commandments were written. For a minute or two they stood gazing at the tarred wall with its white lettering.

"My sight is failing," she said finally. "Even when I was young I could not have read what was written there. But it appears to me that that wall looks different. Are the Seven Commandments the same as they used to be, Benjamin?"

For once Benjamin consented to break his rule, and he read out to her what was written on the wall. There was nothing there now except a single Commandment. It ran:

**ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL**

**BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS**

After that it did not seem strange when next day the pigs who were supervising the work of the farm all carried whips in their trotters. It did not seem strange to learn that the pigs had bought themselves a wireless set, were arranging to install a telephone, and had taken out subscriptions to John Bull, Tit-Bits, and the Daily Mirror. It did not seem strange when Napoleon was seen strolling in the farmhouse garden with a pipe in his mouth—no, not even when the pigs took Mr. Jones's clothes out of the wardrobes and put them on, Napoleon himself appearing in a black coat, ratcatcher breeches, and leather leggings, while his favourite sow appeared in the watered silk dress which Mrs. Jones had been used to wear on Sundays.

A week later, in the afternoon, a number of dogcarts drove up to the farm. A deputation of neighbouring farmers had been invited to make a tour of inspection. They were shown all over the farm, and expressed great admiration for everything they saw, especially the windmill. The animals were weeding the turnip field. They worked diligently, hardly raising their faces from the ground, and not knowing whether to be more frightened of the pigs or of the human visitors.

That evening loud laughter and bursts of singing came from the farmhouse. And suddenly, at the sound of the mingled voices, the animals were stricken with curiosity. What could be happening in there, now that for the first time animals and human beings were meeting on terms of equality? With one accord they began to creep as quietly as possible into the farmhouse garden.

At the gate they paused, half frightened to go on, but Clover led the way in. They tiptoed up to the house, and such animals as were tall enough peered in at the dining-room window. There, round the long table, sat half a dozen farmers and half a dozen of the more eminent pigs, Napoleon himself occupying the seat of honour at the head of the table. The pigs appeared completely at ease in their chairs. The company had been enjoying a game of cards, but had broken off for the moment, evidently in order to drink a toast. A large jug was circulating, and the mugs were being refilled with beer. No one noticed the wondering faces of the animals that gazed in at the window.

Mr. Pilkington, of Foxwood, had stood up, his mug in his hand. In a moment, he said, he would ask the present company to drink a toast. But before doing so, there were a few words that he felt it incumbent upon him to say.

It was a source of great satisfaction to him, he said—and, he was sure, to all others present—to feel that a long period of mistrust and misunderstanding had now come to an end. There had been a time—not that he, or any of the present company, had shared such sentiments—but there had been a time when the respected proprietors of Animal Farm had been regarded, he would not say with hostility, but perhaps with a certain measure of misgiving, by their human neighbours. Unfortunate incidents had occurred, mistaken ideas had been current. It had been felt that the existence of a farm owned and operated by pigs was somehow abnormal and was liable to have an unsettling effect in the neigh-bourhood. Too many farmers had assumed, without due enquiry, that on such a farm a spirit of licence and indiscipline would prevail. They had been nervous about the effects upon their own animals, or even upon their human employees. But all such doubts were now dispelled. Today he and his friends had visited Animal Farm and inspected every inch of it with their own eyes, and what did they find? Not only the most up-to-date methods, but a discipline and an orderliness which should be an example to all farmers everywhere. He believed that he was right in saying that the lower animals on Animal Farm did more work and received less food than any animals in the county. Indeed, he and his fellow-visitors today had observed many features which they intended to introduce on their own farms immediately.

**He would end his remarks, he said, by emphasising once again the friendly feelings that subsisted, and ought to subsist, between Animal Farm and its neighbours. Between pigs and human beings there was not, and there need not be, any clash of interests whatever. Their struggles and their difficulties were one. Was not the labour problem the same everywhere? Here it became apparent that Mr. Pilkington was about to spring some carefully prepared witticism on the company, but for a moment he was too overcome by amusement to be able to utter it. After much choking, during which his various chins turned purple, he managed to get it out: "If you have your lower animals to contend with," he said, "we have our lower classes!" This bon mot set the table in a roar; and Mr. Pilkington once again congratulated the pigs on the low rations, the long working hours, and the general absence of pampering which he had observed on Animal Farm.**

And now, he said finally, he would ask the company to rise to their feet and make certain that their glasses were full. "Gentlemen," concluded Mr. Pilkington, "gentlemen, I give you a toast: To the prosperity of Animal Farm!"

There was enthusiastic cheering and stamping of feet. Napoleon was so gratified that he left his place and came round the table to clink his mug against Mr. Pilkington's before emptying it. When the cheering had died down, Napoleon, who had remained on his feet, intimated that he too had a few words to say.

Like all of Napoleon's speeches, it was short and to the point. He too, he said, was happy that the period of misunderstanding was at an end. For a long time there had been rumours—circulated, he had reason to think, by some malignant enemy—that there was something subversive and even revolutionary in the outlook of himself and his colleagues. They had been credited with attempting to stir up rebellion among the animals on neighbouring farms. Nothing could be further from the truth! Their sole wish, now and in the past, was to live at peace and in normal business relations with their neighbours. This farm which he had the honour to control, he added, was a co-operative enterprise. The title-deeds, which were in his own possession, were owned by the pigs jointly.

**He did not believe, he said, that any of the old suspicions still lingered, but certain changes had been made recently in the routine of the farm which should have the effect of promoting confidence still further. Hitherto the animals on the farm had had a rather foolish custom of addressing one another as "Comrade." This was to be suppressed. There had also been a very strange custom, whose origin was unknown, of marching every Sunday morning past a boar's skull which was nailed to a post in the garden. This, too, would be suppressed, and the skull had already been buried. His visitors might have observed, too, the green flag which flew from the masthead. If so, they would perhaps have noted that the white hoof and horn with which it had previously been marked had now been removed. It would be a plain green flag from now onwards.**

He had only one criticism, he said, to make of Mr. Pilkington's excellent and neighbourly speech. Mr. Pilkington had referred throughout to "Animal Farm." He could not of course know—for he, Napoleon, was only now for the first time announcing it—that the name "Animal Farm" had been abolished. Henceforward the farm was to be known as "The Manor Farm"—which, he believed, was its correct and original name.

"Gentlemen," concluded Napoleon, "I will give you the same toast as before, but in a different form. Fill your glasses to the brim. Gentlemen, here is my toast: To the prosperity of The Manor Farm!"

There was the same hearty cheering as before, and the mugs were emptied to the dregs. But as the animals outside gazed at the scene, it seemed to them that some strange thing was happening. What was it that had altered in the faces of the pigs? Clover's old dim eyes flitted from one face to another. Some of them had five chins, some had four, some had three. But what was it that seemed to be melting and changing? Then, the applause having come to an end, the company took up their cards and continued the game that had been interrupted, and the animals crept silently away.

But they had not gone twenty yards when they stopped short. An uproar of voices was coming from the farmhouse. They rushed back and looked through the window again. Yes, a violent quarrel was in progress. There were shoutings, hangings on the table, sharp suspicious glances, furious denials. The source of the trouble appeared to be that Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington had each played an ace of spades simultaneously.

**Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.**

## 第 10 章

四季流轉，數年經過，壽命較短的動物先後死去。如今，除了幸運草、班傑明、烏鴉摩西和一些豬，其他動物都不記得抗爭以前的事情了。

穆里兒已死，藍鈴、潔西與品契爾亦然，就連瓊斯也走了，他死在威靈頓其他地方，一個酒鬼家裡。而大家都把雪球忘了，拳擊手的事情也只剩下一小部分認識他的人記得。如今，幸運草是頭年邁的肥胖母馬，關節僵硬還經常流眼油，她的年紀已經超過退休年齡兩年。然而，沒有動物真的退休了，以前大家都在討論，大牧場一隅會獨立出來為退休動物所用，但這已經好久沒有動物提起。拿破崙現在是頭一百五十多公斤重的成年種豬，尖叫者則胖到很難睜開眼。只有老班傑明一如過往，差別僅在於嘴邊的毛花白了些，自從拳擊手死後，他更加孤僻寡言了。

農莊的動物數量增加幅度雖然不如早年預期的高，但也相當可觀。許多新生命只透過口耳相傳得知抗爭這個不清不楚的傳說，而從外頭買來的動物在進到農莊前都沒聽過這件事情。除了幸運草以外，農莊現在多了三匹馬，他們身強體壯、任勞任怨，各個都是好同志，可是非常愚笨，字母頂多學到B。這三匹馬對抗爭的故事還有動物主義全盤接受，還特別聽幸運草的話，因為她就像他們的母親。然而，大家懷疑他們聽得懂多少。

農莊現在更繁榮、更井然有序，甚至還從皮金頓那裡買了兩塊地。風車最後終於順利完工，目前農莊有打穀機及乾草堆高機，多蓋了幾棟不同的建築物，溫普則添了輛雙輪馬車。風車始終沒能用來發電，只當作穀物磨坊，但為農莊帶來了豐厚的收入，動物們正努力建造第二座。大家說，等這座風車蓋好就會裝上發電機。不過，雪球當初為動物們勾勒出的美好夢想，像是有電燈及冷熱水的廄棚還有週休四日等，都已不再被提起。拿破崙譴責這些夢想違反動物主義精神，他說最實在的幸福乃是辛勤工作、儉樸生活。

不知道為什麼，雖然農莊欣欣向榮，動物們似乎沒有比較富足。當然，豬和狗例外，或許這多少是因為莊裡有太多豬、狗。他們並非不工作，而是做的事情不一樣。尖叫者總不厭其煩地解釋，他們要忙著監督，好維持事情的條理，這差事怎麼做也做不完，更有很多地方是憑其他動物的智慧所無法理解的。尖叫者舉了例子，豬每天得花費大量精力在一些謎般的事情上，如「卷宗」、「報告」、「筆記」還有「備忘錄」，這些全是很大張的紙，上面要寫滿密密麻麻的文字，寫好後立即丟到火爐裡燒掉。尖叫者表示，這工作對農莊福利影響至鉅。但話說回來，豬和狗不事生產，偏偏他們數量龐大且胃口很好。

至於其他動物，照目前看來其實沒什麼改變。他們常挨餓、睡在稻草上、喝水池水、在田裡工作、冬天受冷、夏天被蒼蠅騷擾。有時候，年紀較長的動物努力探索模糊的記憶，試圖判定現在的生活是否好過抗爭成功初期，也就是瓊斯剛被趕走的時候，但什麼都記不得了。他們找不到東西來跟目前的生活比較，唯一的參考只有尖叫者的一長串數據，那些數目總是顯示一切愈來愈美好。動物們發現這個問題根本無解，然而不管怎樣，他們現在也沒什麼時間能思考。只有老班傑明聲稱自己記得這漫長的一輩子發生過的所有細節，而且知道生活從來沒有變好或變壞，以後也將如此。他說，飢餓、困苦、失望，這些都是生活中改變不了的定數。

不過，動物們從未放棄希望，而且身為動物農莊一員的榮譽感與優越感一直存在於他們心中，片刻未曾消逝。他們依舊是整個國家—整個英格蘭！唯一一座歸動物所有、由動物經營的農莊，動物們總對此驚嘆不已，就算是最年輕或者從幾十公里外的農莊被帶來的新成員也不例外。聽著槍響，看著綠色旗幟在旗杆上飛揚，這些動物內心便洋溢著永不磨滅的驕傲感。聚會演講總會談到過去那段英勇歲月，像是驅逐瓊斯、塗寫七誡以及幾場擊敗人類入侵者的偉大戰爭等等。動物們沒有放棄任何舊日夢想，老少校所預言的動物共和國，領土上那片毫無人類足跡的英格蘭綠地，仍是大家心中的信仰。這個夢想有天會實現，或許不會馬上成真，或許目前活著的動物皆無法親眼見證，但總有那麼一天。農莊內的動物大概還會偷偷地哼唱〈英格蘭之獸〉，不管怎麼說，其實莊內每隻動物都知道這首歌，只是不敢大聲唱出來。他們的生活或許艱辛，心中的希望或許沒有全部達成，但他們很清楚自己和其他動物不一樣。他們挨餓並不是因為要餵飽暴虐的人類，他們辛勤工作至少是為自己努力，他們之間沒有誰是靠兩隻腳站立的，也沒有誰要叫誰「主人」，所有動物一律平等。

初夏某一天，尖叫者命令羊群跟他走，把他們帶到農莊一端的荒地去，那裡長滿了樺樹苗。在尖叫者監督下，羊群吃了一整天樹葉。到了晚上，尖叫者獨自回到農舍，因為天氣暖和，所以他要羊群留在原地。他們在那裡待了整整一個星期，這段時間裡，其他動物沒見著半頭羊。尖叫者每天大部分的時間都和羊群在一起，說是在教他們唱新歌，得選在安靜的地方進行。

羊群回來後沒多久，一個舒服的夜裡，動物們結束工作回到倉舍，院子裡突然傳來可怕的馬鳴聲，大家嚇了一跳，紛紛停下腳步。那是幸運草的叫聲，她再度嘶鳴，所有動物趕忙衝向院子，幸運草所見畫面映入大家眼簾。

一頭豬正在用後腿走路。

沒錯，是尖叫者，他走路的樣子有點笨拙，彷彿還不太習慣以這種姿勢來支撐龐大的身軀，但步伐很平穩，他正在院子裡散步。之後，一長列豬群從農舍大門內走出來，全部用後腿走路，有些走得比其他好，然而其中一兩頭豬甚至有點不穩，看起來好像需要柺杖，不過這些豬各個成功繞了院子一圈。最後，一陣凌厲的狗叫和黑公雞刺耳的啼叫後，拿破崙直挺挺地走了出來，高傲的目光掃視四周，狗群在他身邊蹦蹦跳跳。

拿破崙蹄子夾著一根皮鞭。

現場一片死寂，動物們驚恐地擠在一起，看著豬列隊在院子中緩慢繞行，彷彿整個世界顛倒過來了。第一時間的震驚消退後，動物們突然覺得，雖然狗很恐怖，而且大家那麼多年下來已經習慣對任何事情不抱怨、不批評，但這次該不顧一切地表達些反對意見吧。就在這個時候，所有羊群彷彿接收到暗號齊聲咩叫：

「四足善，雙足更善！四足善，雙足更善！四足善，雙足更善！」

咩叫聲毫不停歇地持續了五分鐘，等到羊群靜下來，大家也沒機會抗議了，因為豬群已經走回農舍裡。

班傑明覺得有動物用鼻子頂他肩膀，回頭看才發現是幸運草，她雙眼老花得比以往更嚴重了。幸運草一語不發地咬著班傑明的鬃毛，把他拉到大穀倉一頭，寫著七誡的那面牆邊。他們站在這面塗滿瀝青的牆壁前，盯著上面的白色字體看了一兩分鐘。

「我眼睛快不行了，」幸運草最後開口道：「就算是年輕的時候，我也讀不懂上面的字，但這面牆看起來好像有點不同。班傑明，七誡的內容依舊是那樣嗎？」

這一次，班傑明同意破個例，將牆上寫的東西念給幸運草聽。如今，這面牆上什麼都沒有，只有一條誡律，內容是：

所有動物一律平等，

但有些動物比其他動物更為平等。

這之後，到了第二天，豬在監督農事時，蹄子上總會夾條皮鞭，他們買了無線收音機，準備要裝電話，訂了《約翰牛報》3、《珍事報》和《每日鏡報》，大家也看過拿破崙嘴裡叼著菸斗在花園裡散步，這些現在已經不足為奇，豬甚至從衣櫥裡拿瓊斯先生的衣服出來穿。拿破崙一身黑色大衣、捕鼠馬褲及皮革綁腿，他最愛的母豬穿著瓊斯太太星期天最常穿的波紋綢洋裝，這些也都見怪不怪了。

一週後，有天下午，幾輛雙輪馬車駛進農莊，原來鄰近農莊受到邀請派代表來參訪。他們整座農莊繞了一圈，對所見到的一切讚歎不已，尤其是風車更為他們所稱道。動物在蘿蔔田裡除草，辛勤工作，臉總是向著地面，不知道是比較怕豬，還是比較怕來訪的人類。

那天晚上，農舍內傳來宏亮的笑聲和歌聲，各種聲音交錯之下，動物們突然感到好奇，動物和人類首次以對等身分碰面，會發生什麼事情呢？於是大家不約而同地爬向農舍花園，儘量不出半點聲響。

動物們在大門前停住，有點不敢再往前走，最後由幸運草帶頭進入，他們踮起腳尖走近房舍，比較高大的動物則從餐廳窗戶往內看。餐桌邊坐著六名農夫以及六隻更為顯眼的豬，拿破崙則坐在桌頭主位，這些豬坐在椅子上看起來很怡然自得。他們之前在玩紙牌遊戲，現在稍作歇息，顯然是準備要乾杯。一個大酒罐在桌上傳來傳去，斟滿一杯杯啤酒，裡頭的人或豬都沒有發現窗戶外有動物滿臉疑惑地向內張望。

狐林農莊的皮金頓先生手拿酒杯站起來，說他希望在場各位可以乾一杯，但在這之前，他認為自己應該先說些話。

皮金頓表示，長久以來的不信任與誤解如今終於告一段落，相信這對他以及在座諸位來說都是件彌足欣慰之事。過去曾有一段時間，不論他自己或在場各位都沒有這樣的感受，當時，人類鄰居對受到敬重的動物農莊所有者懷有疑慮—不是敵意，疑慮罷了。之前發生過不幸事件，也有過一些誤會，大家覺得一座歸豬所有、由豬管理的農莊總是違背常理，可能會為鄰近農莊帶來紛擾。很多農夫不先打聽清楚就以為這樣的農莊鼓吹放縱思想、脫序行為，擔心自己的牲畜或手下也會被影響。但這些疑慮如今盡皆煙消雲散，今天，他和他的朋友參訪動物農莊，親眼目睹農莊內的一點一滴，他們看到了什麼呢？最先進的制度。而且莊內紀律嚴明、井然有序，足以當所有農夫的榜樣。他認為，和威靈頓其他農莊動物比起來，動物農莊裡的低下動物可說做更多的活、吃更少的糧食。事實上，他和其他造訪者今天觀察到許多特點，回去後打算馬上在自家農莊施行。

皮金頓表示自己的話到此為止，還不忘再次強調動物農莊及其鄰居之間已然存在且應該維繫下去的友誼。豬和人類之間沒有、也不該有任何利益衝突，因為他們努力的目標和面臨的困難都一樣，勞力問題不是到處相同嗎？說到這裡，皮金頓顯然是準備幽默一下，但他卻開心到說不出話來。他努力抑制笑意，下巴都憋得發紫了，最後才說出：「你們有低下動物要傷腦筋，我們也有低下階級要處理！」這句妙語在餐桌上引起一陣大笑。之後，皮金頓再次向豬道賀，恭喜他們能以少量配給讓動物長時間工作，一點都不讓動物飲食過量。

最後，皮金頓示意大家站起來，並在杯子裡斟滿酒。「各位先生，」他說道：「各位先生，我們來乾杯，祝動物農莊繁榮昌盛！」

熱烈的喝采聲和跺腳聲四起，拿破崙非常開心，於是離開座位，繞到皮金頓身邊，和他乾完最後一口酒。喝采聲歇止後，依舊以雙腳站立的拿破崙表示也有些話要講。

這席話和拿破崙其他演講一樣簡明扼要。他說，他也很高興看到那一段彼此誤會的時期告一段落。長久以來，始終有謠言說他和其他豬隻同僚在鼓吹顛覆行動，甚至提倡革命，他合理懷疑散布者為某些邪惡敵人，這些敵人把他們講成是抗爭分子，企圖煽動鄰近農莊的動物，但事實是無法扭曲的！一直以來，他們唯一的願望就是與鄰居和平共處、維持正常的貿易關係。之後，拿破崙又補了一句，他有幸治理的這座農莊其實是合作事業，手中的農莊地契其實為所有豬隻共同擁有。

拿破崙表示，過去那些猜忌不會再繼續下去，而且農莊生活習氣最近也做了些改正，相信能進一步增強彼此信任。從過去到現在，農莊動物有個愚蠢的習慣，老是稱呼對方「同志」，這以後要加以禁止。莊內還有一個奇怪規矩，花園裡有根木杆，上面釘了個公豬頭骨，每星期天早晨大家都得列隊經過。這規矩不知道是從哪來的，也要禁止，那顆頭骨現在已經埋起來了。再者，來訪人士不知是否看見旗杆上飄揚的綠色旗幟，若有，應該會注意到原本畫在上面的白蹄、白角已經不見了，這面旗幟今後都會維持綠色素面。

對於皮金頓出色、友善的演說，拿破崙說他只有一點意見，皮金頓先生從頭到尾都以「動物農莊」相稱，當然，皮金頓先生還不知道，畢竟這是拿破崙首次宣布，「動物農莊」這個名字已經廢除，從今以後，這座農莊改名為「曼諾農莊」，拿破崙認為這才是最正確、最初始的名稱。

「各位先生，」拿破崙演講末尾說道：「我也想向大家敬酒，但說辭有點不一樣。現在，請把酒斟滿。各位先生，我敬你們一杯，祝曼諾農莊繁榮昌盛！」

餐廳內再次響起熱情的喝采，大家將酒一飲而盡。外頭的動物盯著裡頭看，他們覺得似乎有點不對勁。豬的臉是不是變了？幸運草老花的雙眼瞥過所有豬隻，有的有五層下巴，有的四層，有的三層，那些不斷融化、改變的是什麼東西？接著，掌聲停歇，餐桌邊的豬和人重新拿起紙牌，繼續玩到一半的遊戲，動物們則悄悄地爬離農舍。

在離開農舍還不到二十公尺的時候，動物們突然停下腳步，因為屋子裡傳來喧鬧聲。他們趕緊往回爬，再度往窗內望去，沒錯，屋裡的豬和人吵得不可開交，他們嘶吼叫罵還拍打桌子，一邊眼神滿是猜忌，一邊不斷矢口否認。爭端好像是拿破崙和皮金頓手上同時持有黑桃Ａ。

十二種不同的聲音同時憤怒叫喊，但其實都一個樣。如今，不須再問豬的臉有什麼變化。外頭的動物看看豬又看看人，看看人又看看豬，接著又看看豬再看看人，眼前已是豬人難辨。
